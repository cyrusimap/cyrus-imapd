We found chatting on IRC has just that little more bandwidth available
for a conversation as opposed to mailing lists and/or bug reports, so we
would like to invite you to join us on IRC if you're interested.

There are often Cyrus developers and experienced administrators hanging
around to talk to in a friendly, helpful environment.

Network: **FreeNode (irc.freenode.net)**

Channel: **#cyrus**

If you have an IRC client installed, you may be able to use this link: irc://irc.freenode.net/cyrus

If you don't have an IRC client, you can use the `FreeNode web client <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=cyrus&prompt=1>`__
