Changes since 3.4.6
===================

Build changes
-------------

* Fixed: Cassandane tests now pass on Debian Bookworm
* PCRE2 is now supported and detected with pkg-config.  If both PCRE and PCRE2
  are available, the older PCRE will be preferred.  To force use of PCRE2 in
  this situation, run configure with the ``--disable-pcre`` option.  Please
  note that on Debian-based systems, PCRE (the old one, no longer maintained)
  is called "pcre3".  Yes, this is confusing.
* Fixed :issue:`4770`: missing include when ssl unavailable (thanks Дилян
  Палаузов)

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed: squat db reindexes are no longer always incremental
* Fixed: squat db corruption from unintentional indexing of fields
  intended to be skipped.  Squat search databases may benefit from a full
  (non-incremental) reindex
* Fixed :issue:`4660`: squat db out of bounds access in incremental reindex
  docID map
* Fixed :issue:`4692`: squat db searches now handle unindexed messages
  correctly again (thanks Gabriele Bulfon)
* Fixed :issue:`4717`: pop3d now avoids splitting ``".\r\n"`` across packet
  boundaries, which can confuse some clients
* Fixed :issue:`4756`: potential uninitialized access in extract_convdata

Other changes
-------------

* Fixed :issue:`4790`: some man pages were missing from distribution tarballs
  (thanks Jakob Gahde)
