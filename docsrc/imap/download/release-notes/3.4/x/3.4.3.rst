Changes since 3.4.2
===================

Build changes
-------------

* Fixed :issue:`3854`: miscellaneous build warnings reported by gcc 8.3.0 with
  optimisations turned on
* Fixed: typos in some GCC feature detection macros
* Fixed :issue:`3769`: undefined reference when using flock locking rather
  than fcntl (thanks Дилян Палаузов)
* Fixed :issue:`3843`: man pages for optional features had been excluded from
  release tarballs

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed :issue:`3605`: don't send unsolicited updates about other mailboxes in
  response to STATUS command.  This is technically okay but can confuse
  clients that don't expect it.
* Fixed :issue:`3664`: flush output when starting IDLE so changes are told
  immediately
* Fixed :issue:`2383`: XFER of a single user or mailbox now works again
* Fixed: XFER no longer tries to sync_restart (and hangs) when the destination
  backend doesn't support XFER-via-replication
* Fixed: XFER now reports an error when the name argument doesn't match
  anything, instead of doing nothing and then reporting that it succeeded at
  it.
* Fixed :issue:`3597`: ignore case difference in 'mailto:' prefix when
  comparing CalDAV ORGANIZERs
* Fixed: compare ORGANIZER in CalDAV requests against user's schedule addresses
* Fixed: scheduling userid now set correctly when virtdomains is disabled or
  a defaultdomain is set
* Fixed: use-after-free in Xapian search error logging
* Fixed :issue:`3750`: use-after-free in JMAP Calendar/set error logging
* Fixed :issue:`3839`: `quota -f -u [user]` no longer removes quota information
  from other, similarly-named users

Other changes
-------------

* The formerly-standalone Cassandane tool has been merged into the
  cyrus-imapd repository, in the 'cassandane' subdirectory.
* XFER will now recognise backends from the upcoming 3.6 and 3.7 versions
