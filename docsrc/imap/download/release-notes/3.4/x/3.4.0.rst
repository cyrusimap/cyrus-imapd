Major changes since the 3.2 series
==================================

* DAV improvements
* Improved performance for users with large folders
* LITERAL- maximum size is now honoured (:rfc:`7888`)
* Support for the ESORT (but not CONTEXT) extension from :rfc:`5267`
* Experimental :draft:`JMAP for Sieve Scripts <draft-murchison-jmap-sieve>`
  support
  (requires `jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`).
* Experimental :draft:`Handling Message Disposition Notification with JMAP
  <draft-ietf-jmap-mdn>` support
  (requires `jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`).
* Experimental JMAP Backup extension (requires
  `jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`).
* Experimental JMAP Notes extension (requires
  `jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`).
* Experimental JMAP Blob extension (requires
  `jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`).
* Experimental JMAP Mail extension (requires
  `jmap_nonstandard_extensions: yes` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`).
* New cyrus.index format v17 adds changes_epoch field, needed by JMAP Backups
  extension
* New `reverseuniqueids` :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` option (default on), which
  improves performance for users with large mailboxes
* Further improvements to the `reverseacls` :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`
  performance option
* Improvements to replication reliability and performance
* Experimental vnd.cyrus.log and vnd.cyrus.jmapquery Sieve extensions
* Experimental Sieve Snooze extension based on
  :draft:`draft-ietf-extra-sieve-snooze`
* Experimental Sieve mailboxid extension based on
  :draft:`draft-ietf-extra-sieve-mailboxid`
* Improvements to conversations
* New `mailbox_maxmessages_addressbook`, `mailbox_maxmessages_calendar`, and
  `mailbox_maxmessages_email` :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` options for providing
  server-wide limits on the amount of objects in any one mailbox, independently
  of quotas.  These default to `0` (unlimited) for backward compatibility, but
  are highly recommended for protecting your server from misbehaving clients.
* New IMAP create/delete behaviour based on
  :draft:`draft-ietf-extra-imap4rev2`: mailboxes containing child mailboxes
  can no longer be deleted; and when creating mailboxes, ancestors will be
  created as needed.
* CRC32 optimisations
* :cyrusman:`quota(8)` and :cyrusman:`cyr_expire(8)` arguments are now in
  the admin namespace like other tools
* Support for per-language indexing and searching
* SNMP support has been removed, as it was broken and unmaintained
* New `sync_rightnow_channel` :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` option to enable
  real-time replication to the specified channel as writes occur.
* Caching of mailbox state for quicker replication turnaround.  Configure
  `sync_cache_db` and `sync_cache_db_path` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` to
  enable.
* New `search-fuzzy-always` annotation allows per-user override of the
  `search_fuzzy_always` :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` option
* New `lmtp_preparse` :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` option for parsing incoming
  messages before locking the mailbox.
* New `search_index_skip_users` and `search_index_skip_domains`
  :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` options for skipping indexing of particular
  users/domains.
* The HTTP Admin module's Currently Running Services feature now works
  on the major BSDs (thanks Felix J. Ogris)
* :cyrusman:`squatter(8)` once again supports the ``-s`` option to skip
  reindexing mailboxes which were not modified since the last index
  (Squat backend only)
* :cyrusman:`squatter(8)` now supports long options
* Improvements to search query normalisation performance


Updates to default configuration
================================

The :cyrusman:`cyr_info(8)` `conf`, `conf-all` and `conf-default` subcommands
accept an `-s <version>` argument to highlight :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`
options that are new or whose behaviour has changed since the specified
version.  We recommend using this when evaluating a new Cyrus version to
check which configuration options you will need to examine and maybe set or
change during the process.

* The `annotation_definitions` file is now loaded case-insensitively
* Implementations may want to revisit their `search_normalisation_max`
  settings, but its default value 1000 is a good conservative choice. Current
  server-grade hardware may use 20000 or more.

Security fixes
==============

* None so far

Significant bugfixes
====================

* Fixed: Sieve Editheader Extension (:rfc:`5293`) now works correctly with
  respect to section 7, Interaction with Other Sieve Extensions.
* Fixed :issue:`2598`: indexed search now works correctly with Squat engine
  again
