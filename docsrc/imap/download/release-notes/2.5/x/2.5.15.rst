Security fixes
--------------

* Fixed CVE-2019-19783_: When creating a missing mailbox as part of a sieve
  'fileinto' directive, lmtpd would create it as administrator, bypassing ACL
  checks.

  lmtpd creates missing mailboxes as part of a sieve 'fileinto'
  directive if:

  * (2.5+) the `anysievefolder` option is enabled (default: not), or
  * (3.0+) the `sieve_extensions` option has the 'mailbox' extension enabled
    (default: enabled) and the 'fileinto' directive contains the ":create"
    argument

  Under these conditions, a user with the ability to upload a custom sieve
  script to their account could use it to create any valid mailbox on the
  server (with ACL inherited from the parent mailbox as usual).

  lmtpd no longer creates these mailboxes as administrator, so users may no
  longer use a 'fileinto' directive to create a mailbox they couldn't create
  otherwise.

Bug fixes
