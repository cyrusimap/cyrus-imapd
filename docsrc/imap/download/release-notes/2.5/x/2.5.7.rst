Changes Since 2.5.6
===================

Security fixes
--------------

* CVE-2015-8077, CVE-2015-8078: protect against integer overflow in urlfetch
  range checks

SSL changes
-----------

* Support for legacy SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols has been removed

  These protocols were previously enabled by default, but could be disabled by
  removing them from ``tls_versions`` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`.  They are
  now completely unsupported.

  Administrators needing to support these protocols may find a patch in
  ``contrib/allow-broken-sslv23.patch``.  With this patch, SSLv2 and SSLv3
  will be disabled by default, but can be enabled by adding them to
  ``tls_versions``.  Users of this patch do so at their own risk.

* Support for TLS compression has been removed (thanks Ondřej Surý)

  This was previously disabled by default, but could be enabled with
  ``tls_compression`` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`.  It is now completely
  unsupported.

  ``-DUSE_SETPROCTITLE``
* Fixed: pop3d no longer applies ``plaintextloginpause`` to TLS connections
