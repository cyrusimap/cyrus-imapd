Release Notes
=============

Cyrus uses an `odd-even release cycle <http://producingoss.com/en/development-cycle.html#release-number-even-odd-strategy>`_.

With our versioning system using ``major.minor.micro`` numbering, the minor (middle)
number reveals whether a version is stable (even), or development-only (odd).

A 3.\ **0**\ .1 release is stable, but a 3.\ **1**\ .4 release is developmental only.

Stable Version
==============

Latest stable version is |imap_stable_release_notes|. Documentation at :cyrus-stable:`/`.


Development Version
===================

Latest development snapshot is |imap_development_release_notes|. Documentation at :cyrus-dev:`/`.

.. warning::

    Development versions are tagged snapshots of the master branch, and should
    be considered for **testing purposes** and **bleeding-edge features** only.
    We will try to tag these snapshots at coherent development points, but
    there will generally be **large breaking changes** occurring between
    releases in this series.
