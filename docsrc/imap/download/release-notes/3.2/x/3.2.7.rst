Changes since 3.2.6
===================

Security fixes:
---------------

* Fixed CVE-2021-32056_: Remote authenticated users could bypass intended
  access restrictions on certain server annotations.  Additionally, a
  long-standing bug in replication did not allow server annotations to be
  replicated.  Combining these two bugs, a remote authenticated user could
  stall replication, requiring administrator intervention.
