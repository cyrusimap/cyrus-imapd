Changes since 3.2.0
===================

Build changes
-------------

* Fixed: build failed on non-x86 platforms (thanks John Paul Adrian Glaubitz)
* Fixed: configure now warns if your `time_t` type is only 32-bit
* Fixed :issue:`3038`: ICU 55 or newer is required (thanks Дилян Палаузов)

Removed experimental features
-----------------------------

The following features were incomplete and not ready for use, but snuck in
well before the 3.2 feature freeze.  They have been removed in 3.2.1, and
their corresponding :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` options have been deprecated:

* per-language Xapian indexing and searches for multilingual mailboxes
* separate Xapian indexing and searches of MIME parts/attachments

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed :issue:`3036`: python2 detection was bad
* Fixed :issue:`2470`: cunit tests used expired certs with tiny keys
* Fixed :issue:`3039`: stats were miscounted on tls connection failure
* Fixed :issue:`3035`: lmtpd aborted on connect when FORTIFY_SOURCE enabled
* Fixed: some cunit tests assumed 64-bit `time_t` without checking
* Fixed: imapd returned OK for slow or cancelled SEARCH requests
* Fixed: mislabelled ISO-2022-JP email bodies now detected
* Fixed: JMAP over-quota errors were reported as `serverFail` rather than
  `overQuota`
* Fixed :issue:`3049`: :cyrusman:`promstatsd(8)` had no man page
* Fixed :issue:`3046`: httpd did not declare environ correctly (thanks
  OBATA Akio)
* Fixed: cunit timeout infrastructure was broken on big-endian systems
* Fixed: crashes on non-x86 platforms due to unaligned memory accesses
  (thanks Xavier Guimard and Stefano Rivera)

Fixes to nonstandard JMAP extensions
------------------------------------

(These extensions are not yet formally standardised, and are only available
with the `jmap_nonstandard_extensions` :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` option
enabled.)

* Fixed: JMAP Performance Extension - guidsearch requires a folder number for
  user inbox
* Fixed: JMAP Calendars Extension - CalendarEvent/get returned wrong results
  for date-only recurring events
* Fixed: JMAP Contacts Extension - state was not cleaned up correctly on
  Contact/copy failure
