Changes since 3.8.1
===================

Build changes
-------------

* Fixed: Cassandane tests now pass on Debian Bookworm
* PCRE2 is now supported and detected with pkg-config.  If both PCRE and PCRE2
  are available, the older PCRE will be preferred.  To force use of PCRE2 in
  this situation, run configure with the ``--disable-pcre`` option.  Please
  note that on Debian-based systems, PCRE (the old one, no longer maintained)
  is called "pcre3".  Yes, this is confusing.
* Fixed :issue:`4770`: missing include when ssl unavailable (thanks Дилян
  Палаузов)

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed :issue:`4650`: :cyrusman:`cyr_info(8)` ``conf``, ``conf-all``, and
  ``conf-default`` subcommands no longer crash
* Fixed: squat db reindexes are no longer always incremental
* Fixed: squat db corruption from unintentional indexing of fields
  intended to be skipped.  Squat search databases may benefit from a full
  (non-incremental) reindex
* Fixed :issue:`4660`: squat db out of bounds access in incremental reindex
  docID map
* Fixed :issue:`4692`: squat db searches now handle unindexed messages
  correctly again (thanks Gabriele Bulfon)
* Fixed :issue:`4710`: crash on copy/append fail in mailbox with custom
  user flags
* Fixed: GETMETADATA no longer shows internal DAV mailboxes (unless
  ``imapmagicplus`` is enabled and the user is authenticated as
  ``username+dav@domain``)
* Fixed :issue:`4717`: pop3d now avoids splitting ``".\r\n"`` across packet
  boundaries, which can confuse some clients
* Fixed :issue:`4756`: potential uninitialized access in extract_convdata
* Fixed :issue:`4771`: potential invalid read in message_parse_received_date
  (thanks Дилян Палаузов)
* Fixed :issue:`4663`: strip known-timezones from iCalendar object (thanks
  Дилян Палаузов)
* Fixed :issue:`4722`: failure in :cyrusman:`dav_reconstruct(1)` when last
  message in mailbox was expunged (thanks Дилян Палаузов)
* Fixed :issue:`4758`: fix renaming mailbox between users
* Fixed :issue:`4424`: DAV requests now respond with 507 rather than 500 when
  mailbox_maxmessages limits exceeded
* Fixed :issue:`4804`: mailbox_maxmessages limits now applied correctly
* Fixed :issue:`4785`: crashes during TLS shutdown (thanks Дилян Палаузов)
* Fixed :issue:`4820`: PREVIEW message attribute must be qstring/literal,
  not an atom
* Fixed :issue:`4828`: the default addressbook can no longer be deleted

Other changes
-------------

* Fixed :issue:`4671`: leniently handle unencoded valid UTF-8 strings in MIME
  headers
* Fixed :issue:`4790`: some man pages were missing from distribution tarballs
  (thanks Jakob Gahde)
