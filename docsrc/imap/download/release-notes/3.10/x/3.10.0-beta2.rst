.. _relnotes-3.10.0-beta2_changes:

Major changes since the 3.8 series
==================================

* URLs found in HTML ``<a>``, ``<area>`` and ``<img>`` tags, as well as "alt"
  text in ``<img>`` tags, are now indexed for search and snippets
* :cyrusman:`cyr_expire(8)` now supports non-day durations in the
  archive/delete/expire annotations
* :cyrusman:`cyr_expire(8)` no longer supports fractional durations in command
  line arguments.  Installations that passed fractional durations such as
  "1.5d" to any of the ``-E``, ``-X``, ``-D``, or ``-A`` arguments must adapt
  these to only use integer durations such as "1d12h"
* :cyrusman:`cyr_expire(8)` now supports the 'noexpire_until' annotation to
  disable cyr_expire per user
* JMAP calendar default alarms are now stored in a non-DAV mailbox annotation.
  See :ref:`upgrade_jmap_default_alarms` for upgrading instructions if you are
  already using the experimental JMAP Calendars API
* Removes support for parsing and generating bytecode for the deprecated
  denotify action and notify actions using the legacy (pre-:rfc:`5435`) syntax.
  Existing bytecode containing these actions will still be executed.  Scripts
  that contain the deprecated denotify action should be rewritten to remove
  them.  Scripts that contain notify actions using the legacy syntax should be
  rewritten to use the syntax in :rfc:`5435`
* Adds support for the "exp" and "nbf" JSON Web Token claims. Thanks Bruno
  Thomas
* Adds support for IMAP Version 4rev2 (:rfc:`9051`)
* Adds support for IMAP NOTIFY (:rfc:`5465`). Only available if ``idled`` is
  running
* Refresh interval for APNS subscriptions to DAV resources is now configurable.
  See the ``aps_expiry`` :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` option
* Upgrade IMAP Quota support to :rfc:`9208`.  Sites running a Murder will be
  unable to set ANNOTATION-STORAGE or MAILBOX quotas (formerly known as
  X-ANNOTATION-STORAGE and X-NUM_FOLDERS) in a mixed-version environment until
  frontends are upgraded.  Upgraded frontends know how to negotiate with older
  backends.
* Adds support for IMAP REPLACE (:rfc:`8508`)
* Adds support for IMAP UIDONLY extension (:draft:`draft-ietf-extra-imap-uidonly`)
* Adds experimental support for JMAP Contacts per upcoming IETF standards.
  Requires the not-yet-released
  `libicalvcard <https://github.com/libical/libical/pull/584>`_
* :cyrusman:`squatter(8)` now supports the "wait=y" :cyrusman:`cyrus.conf(5)`
  option when started in rolling mode from the ``DAEMON`` section
* :cyrusman:`master(8)` now touches a ready file to indicate it is "ready for
  work".  See :ref:`upgrade_master_pid_ready_files`
* :cyrusman:`master(8)` now gets its pidfile name from the ``master_pid_file``
  :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` option.  See :ref:`upgrade_master_pid_ready_files`
* Adds pcre2 support.  Prefers pcre2 over pcre if both are available. See
  :ref:`upgrade_pcre2_support`
* The ``proc`` :cyrusman:`cyr_info(8)` subcommand now also reports DAEMON and
  EVENTS processes
* JMAP CalendarEventNotification objects are now automatically pruned.
  The ``jmap_max_calendareventnotifs`` :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` option can be
  used to tune this behaviour
* Cyrus now requires libical >= 3.0.10 for HTTP support
* Sieve [current]date ``:zone`` parameter now accepts either a UTC offset or an
  IANA time zone ID
* Adds an ``implicit_keep_target`` Sieve action to change the target mailbox
  for an implicit keep
* :cyrusman:`squatter(8)` no longer holds a mailbox lock while extracting text
  from attachments
* IMAP ``RENAME`` command no longer emits non-standard per-folder updates.  Use
  the new ``XRENAME`` command if you need this behaviour

.. _relnotes_3.10.0-beta2_storage_changes:

Storage changes
===============

* None in 3.10.  But if your upgrade is skipping over 3.6 and 3.8, please do
  not miss :ref:`3.6.0 Storage changes <relnotes_3.6.0_storage_changes>`
  and :ref:`3.8.0 Storage changes <relnotes_3.8.0_storage_changes>`

Updates to default configuration
================================

The :cyrusman:`cyr_info(8)` `conf`, `conf-all` and `conf-default` subcommands
accept an `-s <version>` argument to highlight :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`
options that are new or whose behaviour has changed since the specified
version.  We recommend using this when evaluating a new Cyrus version to
check which configuration options you will need to examine and maybe set or
change during the process.

* The master pidfile name is now read from imapd.conf, and defaults
  to ``{configdirectory}/master.pid``.  If you have something that
  looks for this file, you should either update it to look in the new
  default location, or set ``master_pid_file`` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`
  to override the default.  The ``-p`` option to :cyrusman:`master(8)`
  can still be used to override it

Security fixes
==============

* None so far

Significant bugfixes
====================

* Fixed: squat db reindexes are no longer always incremental
* Fixed: squat db corruption from unintentional indexing of fields
  intended to be skipped
* Fixed: squat db out of bounds access in incremental reindex docID map
* Fixed :issue:`4692`: squat db searches now handle unindexed messages
  correctly again (thanks Gabriele Bulfon)
* Restored functionality of the sync_client ``-o``/``--connect-once`` option
* Fixed :issue:`4654`: copying/moving messages from split conversations is now
  correct
* Fixed :issue:`4758`: fix renaming mailbox between users
* Fixed :issue:`4804`: mailbox_maxmessages limits now applied correctly
