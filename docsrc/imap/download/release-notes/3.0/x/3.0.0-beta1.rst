Major changes
=============

*   Support added for FastMail-style conversations (threaded messages).
    (See the ``conversations`` options in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`)

*   Optional Xapian_ integration for faster and shinier search. Note that this requires custom
    patches to Xapian, in this release. (See the ``search_engine`` option in
    :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`)

*   Archive support has arrived! Requires addition of an archive partition. (See ``archive_*``
    options in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`)

*   Basic JMAP_ support. (See ``httpmodules`` in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`)

*   Optional ClamAV_ integration for AntiVirus support is now working again.
    Requires separate installation of ClamAV_. (See configure.ac ``--with-clamav=DIR``)

*   Dropped support for Berkeley DB.

*   The handling of configure options has changed, dropping support for
    ``--with-cyrus-prefix`` and ``--with-service-path`` in favour of the more conventional
    ``--prefix``, ``--bindir``, ``--sbindir``, and ``--libexecdir``.

*   Binaries executed by the :ref:`master(8) <imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-master>`
    service process are now installed to ``--libexecdir``.  Other binaries are installed to
    ``--bindir`` and/or ``--sbindir``.

    The ``make installbinsymlinks`` target can be used to set up symlinks to everything in
    ``--bindir``, if you need that in your environment.


Significant bugfixes
====================

*   Lots of fixes to caldav and carddav.

    Includes the addition of a new daemon (calalarmd) which periodically processes a global
    database containing the "next" alarm for each item, and sends the relevant mboxevents.
    (See configure.ac ``--with-calalarmd``)

*   Replication reliability fixes.

*   Improved ``LIST-EXTENDED``: more imap tests now succeed.
