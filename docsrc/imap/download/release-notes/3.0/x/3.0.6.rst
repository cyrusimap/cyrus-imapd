Changes Since 3.0.5
===================

Experimental features
---------------------

The experimental JMAP support has been removed in 3.0.6.  The JMAP
specification has changed substantially since 3.0.0 was released,
in ways that cannot be simply backported.

If you wish to experiment with or contribute to Cyrus JMAP support,
please check out the unstable 3.1.x release tags, or the git master
branch.

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed :issue:`2177`: murder frontends using TLS no longer crash on starttls
  failure (thanks Wolfgang Breyha)
* Fixed :issue:`2197`: warnings fixed in CYRUS-MASTER.mib (thanks Fabrice
  Bacchella)
* Fixed: :cyrusman:`squatter(8)` no longer crashes when conversations are not
  enabled
* Fixed :issue:`2301`: rolling-mode squatter now works correctly from
  :cyrusman:`cyrus.conf(5)` DAEMON section
* Fixed some compilation warnings in the Xapian wrapper
* Fixed capabilities detection in :cyrusman:`imtest(1)` (thanks Pavel Zhukov)
* Fixed :issue:`2253`: :cyrusman:`master(8)` now rejects service entries with
  listen paths that are too long
* Fixed :issue:`2303`: :cyrusman:`lmtpd(8)` now looks for sieve scripts in the
  same directories as the rest of cyrus (including :cyrusman:`timsieved(8)`).
  Please note that if you had manually installed sieve scripts to the
  directories lmtpd used to look in, these will need to be moved.
* Fixed build failure with LibreSSL 2.7 (thanks Bernard Spil)
* Fixed :issue:`2317`: sieve variables now work correctly in mailboxexists
  tests
* Fixed: squatter manpage now installs correctly when SQUAT engine not in use
  (thanks uutari)
* Fixed: recover from certain IMAP parse errors without losing protocol sync

Other changes
-------------

* Services will now syslog warnings about attempts to access nonexistent
  partitions
* :cyrusman:`reconstruct(8)` now accepts a `-I` argument to enable updating of
  mailbox UNIQUEIDs when clashes are detected, and will not do so without.
  This is useful for preventing problems like :issue:`2240` in replicated
  environments.
