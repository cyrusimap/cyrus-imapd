Changes Since 3.0.2
===================

Security fixes
--------------

An authenticated non-admin IMAP user could overwrite an arbitrary file (subject
to cyrus user permissions) with specially crafted SYNCAPPLY, SYNCGET or
SYNCRESTORE commands.

This issue was introduced with commit
`152f59c <https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-imapd/commit/152f59c608232711f9c58821ac245617544c1b91>`_
and affects all releases from the 3.0 series prior to this.  2.5 and earlier
are not affected.

It is fixed by commits
`53c4137 <https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-imapd/commit/53c4137bd924b954432c6c59da7572c4c5ffa901>`_
and
`5edadcf <https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-imapd/commit/5edadcfb83bf27107578830801817f9e6d0ad941>`_.

Other changes
-------------

* Improved JMAP support
* imapd client_id log lines now include the session id

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed :issue:`1090`: non-standard NO response to ID command
* Fixed: uninitialised buffer in ischedule

Erratum
-------

Earlier release notes from the 3.0 series stated that the default value of
the ``virtdomains`` option had changed from ``off`` to ``userid``.  This is
not the case: the default is still ``off``, and will remain so for the life
of the 3.0 series.
