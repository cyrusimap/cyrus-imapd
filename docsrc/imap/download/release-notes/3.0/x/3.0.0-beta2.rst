Major changes since the 2.5.x series
====================================

*   Support added for FastMail-style conversations (threaded messages).
    (See the ``conversations`` options in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`)

*   Optional Xapian_ integration for faster and shinier search. Note that this requires custom
    patches to Xapian, in this release. (See the ``search_engine`` option in
    :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`, and ``doc/README.xapian`` in the
    source distribution.))

*   Archive support has arrived! Requires addition of an archive partition. (See ``archive_*``
    options in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`)

*   Basic JMAP_ support. (See ``httpmodules`` in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`)

*   Optional ClamAV_ integration for AntiVirus support is now working again.
    Requires separate installation of ClamAV_. (See configure.ac ``--with-clamav=DIR``)

*   Dropped support for Berkeley DB.

*   The handling of configure options has changed, dropping support for
    ``--with-cyrus-prefix`` and ``--with-service-path`` in favour of the more conventional
    ``--prefix``, ``--bindir``, ``--sbindir``, and ``--libexecdir``.

*   Binaries executed by the :ref:`master(8) <imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-master>`
    service process are now installed to ``--libexecdir``.  Other binaries are installed to
    ``--bindir`` and/or ``--sbindir``.

    The ``make installbinsymlinks`` target can be used to set up symlinks to everything in
    ``--bindir``, if you need that in your environment.

*   Added support for replicating mailboxes/users to a particular partition.  ``sync_client``
    now accepts a ``-p`` option.

*   The ``defaultdomain`` setting in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`
    now defaults to "internal" (was: NULL)

*   Added experimental backup service.  See ``docs/install-backup.html`` in the source
    distribution for preliminary installation/configuration/administration documentation.

*   Support for Apple's Push service (XAPPLEPUSH).  See :ref:`Cyrus Eventsource <cyrus-eventsource>`

*   Sieve now supports special use folders.  See :ref:`Cyrus Sieve <cyrus-sieve-specialuse>`

*   New numeric header available for sorting: X-Spam-Score

*   Added IMIP notification support to :ref:`notifyd(8) <imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-notifyd>`.  See
    ``imipnotifier`` in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`

*   Optimised CRC32 implementation

*   Added support for reverse ACLs, enabling faster LIST response.  See ``reverseacls`` in
    :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`

*   Added cross-domain sharing support.  See ``crossdomains`` and ``crossdomains_onlyother``
    in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`

*   Added experimental object storage for mail data, with preliminary support for OpenIO and
    Caringo backends.  See configure.ac ``--enable-objectstore``, and the ``object_storage_*``,
    ``openio_*`` and ``caringo_*`` options in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`.

*   Configurable POP3 UIDL format for compatibility with other mail servers.  Supports
    Courier Mail Server and Dovecot formats, in addition to Cyrus formats.  See ``uidl_format``
    in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`

*   Sieve now supports the :rfc:`5490` Checking Mailbox Status and Accessing Mailbox Metadata
    extensions.  See ``sieve_extensions`` in :ref:`imapd.conf <imap-reference-manpages-configs-imapd.conf>`

*   Under ``delete_mode: delayed``, only the 20 most recently deleted mailboxes are kept
    for any given name.


Significant bugfixes
====================

*   Lots of fixes to caldav and carddav.

    Includes the addition of a new daemon (calalarmd) which periodically processes a global
    database containing the "next" alarm for each item, and sends the relevant mboxevents.
    (See configure.ac ``--with-calalarmd``)

*   Replication reliability fixes.

*   Improved ``LIST-EXTENDED``: more imap tests now succeed.

*   Extensive cleanup of mailbox name handling

*   ``master`` now requests a sane maximum number of open file descriptors, and only
    complains if this isn't allowed.

*   Fixes to compiling on Solaris (thanks Jens Erat, Marty Lee)

*   Improved handling of mailbox renames during replication
