Changes Since 3.0.16
====================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed :issue:`2383`: XFER of a single user or mailbox now works again
* Fixed: XFER no longer tries to sync_restart (and hangs) when the destination
  backend doesn't support XFER-via-replication
* Fixed: XFER now reports an error when the name argument doesn't match
  anything, instead of doing nothing and then reporting that it succeeded at
  it.

Other changes
-------------

* The formerly-standalone Cassandane tool has been merged into the
  cyrus-imapd repository, in the 'cassandane' subdirectory.
* XFER will now recognise backends from the upcoming 3.6 and 3.7 versions
