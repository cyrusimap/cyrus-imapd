Changes Since 3.0.17
====================

Build changes
-------------

* Fixed: iCal GEO property is text in new libical versions
* Fixed: docs now build correctly with python3 and Sphinx 3.4

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed :issue:`4002`: cyradm: allow LIST command even when support_referrals
  is false
* Fixed :issue:`4216`: httpd killed by SIGSEGV for calendar request (thanks
  Дилян Палаузов)

Other changes
-------------

* Fixed :issue:`4380`: ``backend_version()`` now properly parses the remote
  server's version string, and can recognise when it is newer than the local
  server.  This means XFER to a newer backend no longer requires a local
  software update to recognise the new version number first.
