Cyrus IMAP 3.9 Tags
===================

.. warning::

    The 3.9 series are tagged snapshots of the master branch, and should be
    considered for **testing purposes** and **bleeding-edge features** only.
    We will try to tag these snapshots at coherent development points, but
    there will generally be **large breaking changes** occurring between
    releases in this series.
