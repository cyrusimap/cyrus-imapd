`Download a versioned tarball`_. Latest stable version is |imap_current_stable_version|.

Extract the tarball:

Use the source from Git
-----------------------

Read our :ref:`Guide to GitHub <github-guide>` for details on how to
access our GitHub repository, and fork/clone the source.

External Tools
==============

These are projects that are not directly developed or managed
under the umbrella of the Cyrus Project, but may provide enhancements
or additional functionality.

Both of these projects are not under active development, but are
definitely worthwhile and would be Good Things to have available.
If you think you'd be interested in taking them on and bringing them
up to speed, we encourage you to contact the original authors.

There is an effort to develop `Cyrus utilities <http://sourceforge.net/projects/cyrus-utils/>`_.

Additionally, a Cyrus administrative GUI is available from http://korreio.sf.net

Licensing
=========

All versions of the Cyrus IMAP server and Cyrus SASL library are now
