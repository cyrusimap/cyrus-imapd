Upgrading to 3.0
================

.. note::

    This guide assumes that you are familiar and comfortable with administration of a
    Cyrus installation, and system administration in general.

    It assumes you are installing from source or tarball. If you want to install from package,
    use the upgrade instructions from the package provider.

1. Preparation
--------------

Things to consider **before** you begin:

Installation from tarball
#########################

You will need to install from our packaged tarball. We provide a full list of libraries that Debian requires, but we aren't able to test all platforms: you may find you need to install additional or different libraries to support v3.0.

How are you planning on upgrading?
##################################

Ideally, you will do a sandboxed test installation of 3.0 using a snapshot of your existing data before you switch off your existing installation. The rest of the instructions are assuming a sandboxed 3.0 installation.

If you're familiar with replication, and your current installation is 2.4 or newer, you can set up your existing
installation to replicate data to a new 3.0 installation and failover to the new installation when you're
ready. The replication protocol has been kept backwards compatible.

If you are upgrading in place, you will need to shut down Cyrus
entirely while you install the new package.  If your old installation
was using Berkeley DB format databases, you will need to convert or
upgrade the databases **before** you upgrade.  Cyrus v3.0 does not
support Berkeley DB at all.

Do What As Who?
###############

Since the various files, databases, directories, etc. used by Cyrus
must be readable and writable as the ``cyrus`` user, please make sure
to **always** perform Cyrus commands *as* the ``cyrus`` user, and not
as ``root``.  In our documentation, we will always reference Cyrus
commands in this form -- :cyrusman:`cyr_info(8)` -- before using
examples of them, so you'll know that those commands **must** be run as
the ``cyrus`` user.

Doing so in most systems is as simple as using either the ``su`` or
``sudo`` commands, like so::

    su cyrus -c "/usr/local/bin/cyr_info conf-lint -C /etc/imapd.conf -M /etc/cyrus.conf"
    sudo -u cyrus /usr/local/bin/cyr_info conf-lint -C /etc/imapd.conf -M /etc/cyrus.conf

In this document, however, there are also several command examples which
*should* or **must** be run as ``root``.  These are always standard \*nix
commands, such as ``rsync`` or ``scp``.

We strongly recommend that you read this entire document before upgrading.

2. Install new 3.0 Cyrus
------------------------

Download the release :ref:`3.0 package tarball <getcyrus>`.

Fetch the libraries for your platform. The full list (including all optional packages) for Debian is::

    sudo apt-get install -y autoconf automake autotools-dev bash-completion bison build-essential comerr-dev \
    debhelper flex g++ git gperf groff heimdal-dev libbsd-resource-perl libclone-perl libconfig-inifiles-perl \
    libcunit1-dev libdatetime-perl libdb-dev libdigest-sha-perl libencode-imaputf7-perl libfile-chdir-perl \
    libglib2.0-dev libical-dev libio-socket-inet6-perl libio-stringy-perl libjansson-dev libldap2-dev \
    libmysqlclient-dev libnet-server-perl libnews-nntpclient-perl libpam0g-dev libpcre3-dev libsasl2-dev \
    libsnmp-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libtest-unit-perl libtool libunix-syslog-perl liburi-perl \
    libxapian-dev libxml-generator-perl libxml-xpath-perl libxml2-dev libwrap0-dev libzephyr-dev lsb-base \
    net-tools perl php-cli php-curl pkg-config po-debconf tcl-dev \
    transfig uuid-dev vim wamerican wget xutils-dev zlib1g-dev sasl2-bin rsyslog sudo acl telnet

If you're on another platform and can provide the list of dependencies, please
let us know via a `GitHub issue <https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-imapd/issues>`_ or documentation pull request or send mail to the :ref:`developer list<feedback-mailing-lists>`.

Follow the :ref:`general install instructions <installing>`.

.. note::

    It's best to ensure your new Cyrus *will not* start up automatically
    if your server restarts in the middle of the upgrade.

    How this is best achieved will depend upon your OS and distro, but may involve
    something like ``systemctl disable cyrus-imapd`` or ``update-rc.d cyrus-imapd disable``

3. Shut down existing Cyrus
---------------------------

Shut down your existing Cyrus installation with its init script or
whatever method you normally use.

This is necessary to guarantee a clean data snapshot.

4. Backup and Copy existing data
--------------------------------

We recommend backing up all your data before continuing.

* Sieve scripts
* Config files
* Mail spool
* :ref:`Cyrus Databases <databases>`

(You do already have a backup strategy in place, right? Once you're on 3.0, you can
consider using the new inbuilt :ref:`backup tools <cyrus-backups>`.)

Copy all of this to the new instance, using ``rsync`` or similar tools.

.. note::

    Cyrus keeps its data and databases in various locations, some of
    which may be tailored by your configuration.  Please consult
    :ref:`imap-admin-locations` for guidance on where data lives in your
    current installation.

For example, to copy from an existing Debian or Ubuntu installation
using their standard locations, you might execute this series of
commands on the *new* server (where "oldimap" is the name of the old
server)::

    rsync -aHv oldimap:/var/lib/cyrus/. /var/lib/cyrus/.
    rsync -aHv oldimap:/var/spool/cyrus/. /var/spool/cyrus/.

You don't need to copy the following databases as Cyrus 3.0 will
recreate these for you automatically:

* duplicate delivery (deliver.db),
* TLS cache (tls_sessions.db),
* PTS cache (ptscache.db),
* STATUS cache (statuscache.db).

.. note::
    You may wish to consider relocating these four databases to ephemeral
    storage, such as ``/run/cyrus`` (Debian/Ubuntu) or ``/var/run/cyrus``
    or whatever suitable tmpfs is provided on your distro.  It will place
    less IO load on your disks and run faster.

.. warning::
    Please be warned that some packages place tasks such as ``tlsprune``
    (:cyrusman:`tls_prune(8)`) in the ``START{}`` stanza of
    :cyrusman:`cyrus.conf(5)`.  This will cause a startup problem if the
    ``tls_sessions_db`` is not present.  The solution to this is to
    remove the ``tlsprune`` task from ``START{}`` and schedule it in
    ``EVENTS{}``, further down.


5. Copy config files and update
-------------------------------

Again, check the locations on your specific installation.  For example,
on FreeBSD systems, the configuration files :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`
and :cyrusman:`cyrus.conf(5)` are in ``/usr/local/etc``, rather than
``/etc/``.  Run this command on the *old* server::

    scp /etc/cyrus.conf /etc/imapd.conf newimap:/etc/

Using the :cyrusman:`cyr_info(8)` command, check to see if your
imapd.conf file contains any deprecated options. Run this command on
the new server::

    cyr_info conf-lint -C <path to imapd.conf> -M <path to cyrus.conf>

You need to provide both imapd.conf and cyrus.conf so that conf-lint knows
the names of all your services and can check service-specific overrides.

To check your entire system's configuration you can use the conf-all
action. This command takes all the system defaults, along with anything
you have provided overrides for in your config files::

    cyr_info conf-all -C <path to imapd.conf> -M <path to cyrus.conf>

**Important config** options: ``unixhierarchysep:`` and ``altnamespace:``
defaults have changed in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`. Implications are
outlined in the Note in :ref:`imap-admin-namespaces-mode` and
:ref:`imap-switching-alt-namespace-mode`.  Please also see "Sieve Scripts,"
below.

* unixhierarchysep: on
* altnamespace: on

.. note::
    If your installation is using groups, don't turn ``reverseacls:`` on. Reverseacl support
    only works well for sites without groups.

6. Upgrade specific items
-------------------------

* Special-Use flags

   If your 2.4 :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` made use of the ``xlist-XX``
   directive(s), you can convert these to per-user special-use annotations
   in your new install with the :cyrusman:`cvt_xlist_specialuse(8)` tool

* Sieve Scripts

    Since defaults for options: ``unixhierarchysep:`` and
    ``altnamespace:`` have changed in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`, you
    may very likely need to modify any sieve scripts already on your
    system.  Fear not, there's a tool for this task, called
    :cyrusman:`translatesieve(8)`.  This tool can handle situations
    where either or both of these settings need change. Please consult
    the man page for details.

    Consider the following example, where the prior configuration was
    already using ``altnamespace: on``, but was *not* using
    ``unixhierarchysep: on``::

        # su cyrus -c "/usr/lib/cyrus/upgrade/translatesieve -a"
        you are using /var/lib/imap/sieve as your sieve directory.
        translating sievedir /var/lib/imap/sieve... converting separator from '.' to '/'
        not changing name space.
        done

.. warning::

    **Berkeley db format no longer supported**

    If you have any databases using Berkeley db, they'll need to be
    converted to skiplist or flat *in your existing installation*. And
    then optionally converted to whatever final format you'd like in
    your 3.0 installation.

    Databases potentially affected: mailboxes, annotations, conversations, quotas.

    On old install, prior to migration::

       cvt_cyrusdb /<confdir>mailboxes.db berkeley /tmp/new-mailboxes.db skiplist

    If you don't want to use flat or skiplist for 3.0, you can use the
    new 3.0 :cyrusman:`cvt_cyrusdb(8)` to swap to new format::

       cvt_cyrusdb /tmp/new-mailboxes.db skiplist /<confdir>/mailboxes.db <new file format>

.. note::
    The :cyrusman:`cvt_cyrusdb(8)` command does not accept relative paths.

7. Start new 3.0 Cyrus and verify
---------------------------------

::

    sudo ./master/master -d

Check ``/var/log/syslog`` for errors so you can quickly understand potential problems.

When you're satisfied version 3.0 is running and can see all its data correctly,
start the new Cyrus up with your regular init script.

If something has gone wrong, contact us on the :ref:`mailing list <feedback-mailing-lists>`.
You can revert to backups and keep processing mail using your old version
until you're able to finish your 3.0 installation.

.. note::

    If you've disable your system startup scripts, as recommended in
    step 2, remember to re-enable them.  Use something like ``systemctl
    enable cyrus-imapd`` or ``update-rc.d cyrus-imapd enable``

8. Reconstruct databases and cache
----------------------------------

The following steps can each take a long time, so we recommend
running them one at a time (to reduce locking contention and high I/O load).

To upgrade all the mailboxes to the latest version. This will take hours, possibly days.

::

    reconstruct -V max

New configuration: if turning on conversations, you need to create conversations.db for each user.
(This is required for jmap).::

     ctl_conversationsdb -b -r

To check (and correct) quota usage::

    quota -f

If you've been using CalDAV/CardDAV/all of the DAV from earlier releases, then the user.dav
databases need to be reconstructed due to format changes.::

    dav_reconstruct -a

9. Do you want any new features?
--------------------------------

3.0 comes with many lovely new features. Consider which ones you want to enable.
Here are some which may interest you. Check the :ref:`3.0 release notes <imap-release-notes-3.0>`
for the full list.

* :ref:`JMAP <developer-jmap>`
* :ref:`Backups <cyrus-backups>`
* :ref:`Xapian for searching <imapinstall-xapian>`
* Cross-domain support. See ``crossdomains`` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`

10. Upgrade complete
--------------------

Your upgrade is complete! We have a super-quick survey (3 questions only,
anonymous responses) we would love for you to fill out, so we can get a feel for
how many Cyrus installations are out there, and how the upgrade process went.

Special note for Murder configurations
--------------------------------------

If you upgrade murder frontends before you upgrade all the backends,
they may advertise features to clients which the backends don't support,
which will cause the commands to fail when they are proxied to the backend.

Generally accepted wisdom when upgrading a Murder configuration is to
upgrade all your back end servers first. This can be done one at a time.

Upgrade your mupdate master and front ends last.
