Help! There must be an easier way to get all this going...
----------------------------------------------------------

Currently, the Cyrus project only distributes Cyrus IMAPd and Cyrus SASL
as source code. If you prefer not to work directly with the source
distribution - you don't have the time to learn it, find it too
difficult, or it's otherwise unsuitable - there are a few other options.

There are a number of projects outside the main Cyrus project that
provide easy-to-install packages of the Cyrus software. Additionally,
there are a fair few commercial software packages that include the Cyrus
software as a component. Our :ref:`installation guide <setup>`
page lists these.

Most people active on the :ref:`info-cyrus mailing list <feedback-mailing-lists>`
appear to use the source distribution, so more people are likely to be
familiar with that than any vendor-specific custom versions.

Additionally, it can be easier to upgrade to the latest version if
you're using the source packages.

Finally: you learn more! In the end,
the best way to get Cyrus depends on what your specific needs are.
