***********
DESCRIPTION
***********


This module implements \ **cyradm**\  in Perl.  It is a shell around
`Cyrus::IMAP::Admin <http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Cyrus%3a%3aIMAP%3a%3aAdmin&mode=module>`_.  Commands are provided in both Tcl-compatible
forms and GNU-style long option forms.

The \`\`cyradm\`\` utility is a simple command line for performing common
administrative tasks on a Cyrus IMAP server, written in Perl.

The cyradm utility can either be executed from a client where it has been
installed and connect to the server via IMAP or it can be executed
locally via a shell on the server.

cyradm understands /bin/sh-style redirection: any command can have its 
standard or error output redirected, with all sh-style redirections 
(except \<\>) supported. It does not currently understand pipes or 
backgrounding.

If the `Term::Readline::Perl <http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Term%3a%3aReadline%3a%3aPerl&mode=module>`_ or `Term::Readline::GNU <http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Term%3a%3aReadline%3a%3aGNU&mode=module>`_ modules are 
available, cyradm will use it.

COMMANDS
********


.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-authenticate:

authenticate
============


\ **authenticate**\  [\ ``--minssf``\  \ *N*\ ] [\ ``--maxssf``\  \ *N*\ ] [\ ``--mechanisms``\  \ *list*\ ] [\ ``--service``\  \ *name*\ ] [\ ``--tlskey``\  \ *keyfile*\ ] [\ ``--notls``\ ] [\ ``--cafile``\  \ *cacertfile*\ ] [\ ``--capath``\  \ *cacertdir*\ ] \ *user*\ 

Authenticate to server.  You must already be connected to a server and
Cyrus imapd will refuse to allow you to re-authenticate once you have
authenticated once.

aliases: \ ``auth``\ , \ ``login``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-chdir:


chdir
=====


\ **chdir**\  \ *directory*\ 

Change directory.  A \ ``pwd``\  builtin is not provided, but the default command
action will run \ ``pwd``\  from a shell if invoked.

aliases: \ ``cd``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-createmailbox:


createmailbox
=============


\ **createmailbox**\  [\ ``--partition``\  \ *partition*\ ] [\ ``--specialuse``\  \ *specialuse*\ ] \ *mailbox*\ 

\ **createmailbox**\  [\ ``--specialuse``\  \ *specialuse*\ ] \ *mailbox*\  \ *partition*\ 

Create a mailbox on the default or a specified partition.  Both old-style
and getopt-style usages are accepted (combining them will produce an error).
Optionally assign a special use to the mailbox.

New mailboxes inherit the ACL permissions of
their parent mailbox, except for top-level mailboxes such as the user's
INBOX. Mailboxes that are the user's INBOX are assigned all to the
corresponding user.


Example Usage
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
      localhost> :command:`cm user.john`
      localhost> :command:`lm`
      user.john (\HasNoChildren)
      localhost> :command:`lam user.john`
      john lrswipkxtecda
 
 
 Note that in the above example, the \ ``unixhierarchysep``\  setting in
 imapd.conf is set to \ ``0``\ . When using the UNIX
 hierarchy seperator, the \ ``/``\  (forward slash) character would be
 used as the hierarchy seperator, and the example would look as
 follows:
 


Example Usage with \ ``unixhierarchysep: 1``\ 
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
      localhost> :command:`cm user/john`
      localhost> :command:`lm`
      user/john (\HasNoChildren)
      localhost> :command:`lam user/john`
      john lrswipkxtecda
 
 


Note
 
 The above examples use the unqualified, shorthand user
 identifier john as the mailbox name.
 
 With the use of virtual domains, controlled through the
 \ ``virtdomains``\  setting in imapd.conf(5).
 


aliases: \ ``cm``\ , \ ``create``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-deleteaclmailbox:


deleteaclmailbox
================


\ **deleteaclmailbox**\  \ *mailbox*\  \ *id*\  [...]

Remove ACLs from the specified mailbox.

aliases: \ ``delteacl``\ , \ ``dam``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-deletemailbox:


deletemailbox
=============


\ **deletemailbox**\  \ *mailbox*\ 

Delete the specified mailbox.

Administrators do not have implicit delete rights on mailboxes.  Use the
`setaclmailbox`_ command to grant the \ ``x``\  permission to your
principal if you need to delete a mailbox you do not own.

Note that the online help admits to an optional host argument.  This argument
is not currently used, and will be rejected with an error if specified; it
is reserved for IMSP.

aliases: \ ``delete``\ , \ ``dm``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-disconnect:


disconnect
==========


\ **disconnect**\ 

Disconnect from the current server.  The prompt will revert to \ ``cyradm>``\ . 
This does not quit cyradm.

aliases: \ ``disc``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-exit:


exit
====


\ **exit**\  [\ *number*\ ]

Exit \ ``cyradm``\ , optionally with a specific exit status; the exit status of the
last command will be used if one is not specified.

aliases: \ ``quit``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-help:


help
====


\ **help**\  [command]

Show help for \ ``command``\  or all commands.

aliases: \ ``?``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-info:


info
====


\ **info**\  [\ *mailbox*\ ]

Display the mailbox/server metadata.

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-listaclmailbox:


listaclmailbox
==============


\ **listaclmailbox**\  \ *mailbox*\ 

List ACLs on the specified mailbox.

aliases: \ ``lam``\ , \ ``listacl``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-listmailbox:


listmailbox
===========


\ **listmailbox**\  [\ ``--subscribed``\ ] [\ ``--specialuse``\ ] [\ *pattern*\  [\ *reference*\ ]]

List all, or all subscribed or special-use, mailboxes matching the specified
pattern.  The pattern may have embedded wildcards \ ``'\*'``\  or \ ``'%'``\ , which
match anything or anything except the separator character, respectively.

Mailboxes returned will be relative to the specified reference if one
is specified.  This allows a mailbox list to be limited to a particular
hierarchy.

In some cases when the \ ``'%'``\  wildcard is used to end a pattern, it may
match an entry which is not a mailbox but which contains other mailboxes.
In this case, the entry will be parenthesized to indicate that it is a
root for other mailboxes, as opposed to a mailbox itself.

aliases: \ ``list``\ , \ ``lm``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-listquota:


listquota
=========


\ **listquota**\  \ *root*\ 

List quotas on specified root.  If the specified mailbox path does not have
a quota assigned, an error will be raised; see `listquotaroot`_ for a way to
find the quota root for a mailbox.

aliases: \ ``lq``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-listquotaroot:


listquotaroot
=============


\ **listquotaroot**\  \ *mailbox*\ 

Show quota roots and quotas for mailbox

aliases: \ ``lqm``\ , \ ``lqr``\ 

.. _imap-reference-manpages-systemcommands-cyradm-mboxconfig:


mboxconfig
==========


\ **mboxconfig**\  [\ ``--private``\ ] \ *mailbox*\  \ *attribute*\  \ *value*\ 

Set mailbox metadata, optionally set the private instead of the shared
version of the metadata. A value of "none" will remove the attribute.

\ ``comment``\  \ *description*\ 
 
 Sets a comment or description associated with the mailbox.
 


\ ``expire``\  \ *days*\ 
 
 Sets the number of days after which messages will be expired from the mailbox.

 not see messages whose internaldate is before or equal to the date.
 


\ ``sharedseen``\  \ *true|false*\ 
 
 Enables the use of a shared \Seen flag on messages rather than a
 per-user \Seen flag.  The 's' right in the mailbox ACL still controls
 whether a user can set the shared \Seen flag.
 


\ ``sieve``\  \ *scriptname*\ 
 
 Indicates the name of the global sieve script that should be run when
 a message is delivered to the shared mailbox (not used for personal

\ **renamemailbox**\  \ *oldname*\  \ *newname*\  [\ *partition*\ ]

Rename the specified mailbox, optionally moving it to a different partition.
Both old-style and getopt-style usages are accepted; combining them will
produce an error.

server.  It will prompt for automatic login unless the \ ``--noauthenticate``\ 
option is specified.  (This may change; in particular, either automatic
authentication will be removed or all `authenticate`_ options will be added.)

When connected to a server, \ **cyradm**\ 's prompt changes from \ ``cyradm>``\  to
\ ``servername>``\ , where \ *servername*\  is the fully qualified domain name
of the connected server.

aliases: \ ``connect``\ , \ ``servername``\

*****
NOTES
*****


GNU-style long options must be given in their entirety; Tcl-style options
may be abbreviated.

Tcl-style options are provided as a compatibility feature.  They will
probably go away in the future.

Multiple commands can be given on a line, separated by \ ``';'``\  characters.

All commands set an exit status, which at present is not useful.

Unknown commands are passed to a subshell for execution.

The Tcl version of \ **cyradm**\  is used for scripting as well as interactively.
While this is possible to a limited extent by use of the \ ``run``\  method,
scripting would normally be done with \ ``Cyrus::IMAP::Admin``\ , which is far
more flexible than either interactive \ ``cyradm``\  or the Tcl scripting
mechanism for Cyrus.

\ **cyradm**\  understands \ **/bin/sh**\ -style redirection:  any command can have
its standard or error output redirected, with all \ **sh**\ -style redirections
(except \ ``<>``\ ) supported.  It does not currently understand pipes
or backgrounding.

If the \ ``Term::Readline::Perl``\  or \ ``Term::Readline::GNU``\  modules are
available, \ **cyradm**\  will use it.

An alias facility is implemented internally, but no access is currently
provided to it.  This will change, if only to allow some of the predefined
aliases to be removed if they conflict with useful shell commands.
