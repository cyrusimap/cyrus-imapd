Description
===========

**reconstruct** rebuilds one or more IMAP mailboxes.  It can be
used to recover from almost any sort of data corruption.

If **reconstruct** can find existing header and index files, it
attempts to preserve any data in them that is not derivable from the
message files themselves. The state **reconstruct** attempts to
preserve includes the flag names, flag state, and internaldate.

**reconstruct** derives all other information from the message files.

**reconstruct** |default-conf-text|  Any mailbox directory underneath
the path specified in the ``partition-news`` configuration option is
assumed to be in news format.

**reconstruct** does not adjust the quota usage recorded in any quota
root files.  After running **reconstruct**, it is advisable to run
:manpage:`quota(8)` with the **-f** switch in order to fix the quota
root files.

When upgrading versions of Cyrus software, it may be necessary to run
**reconstruct** with the **-V** option, to rebuild indexes to a
given version (or *max* for the most recent).  Note that the **-V**
option cannot be combined with most other reconstruct options.  If
a mailbox needs reconstructing you should do that first, and then
upgrade it with **-V** once it's good.

Options
=======

.. program:: reconstruct

.. option:: -C config-file

    |cli-dash-c-text|

.. option:: -p partition, --partition=partition

    Search for the listed (non-existant) mailboxes on the indicated
    *partition*. Create the mailboxes in the database in addition to
    reconstructing them. (not compatible with the use of wildcards)

.. option:: -x, --ignore-disk-metadata

    When processing a mailbox which is not in the mailbox list (e.g.
    via the **-p** or **-f** options), do not import the metadata from
    the mailbox, instead create it anew (this specifically affects at
    least the mailbox's seen state unique identifier, user flags, and
    ACL).

.. option:: -r, --recursive

    Recursively reconstruct all sub-mailboxes of the mailboxes or
    mailbox prefixes given as arguments.

.. option:: -f, --scan-filesystem

    Examine the filesystem underneath mailbox, adding all directories
    with a ``cyrus.header`` found there as new mailboxes.  Useful for
    restoring mailboxes from backups.

.. option:: -s, --no-stat

    Don't stat underlying files.  This makes reconstruct run faster, at
    the expense of not noticing some issues (like zero byte files or
    size mismatches).  "**reconstruct -s**" should be quite fast.

.. option:: -q, --quiet

    Emit less verbose information to syslog.

.. option:: -n, --dry-run

    Don't make any changes.  Problems are reported, but not fixed.

.. option:: -G, --force-reparse

    Force re-parsing of the underlying message (checks GUID
    correctness). Reconstruct with -G should fix all possible
    individual message issues, including corrupted data files.

.. option:: -I, --update-uniqueids

    If two mailboxes exist with the same UNIQUEID and reconstruct visits
    both of them, -I will cause the second mailbox to have a new UNIQUEID
    created for it.  If you don't specify -I, you will just get a syslog
    entry telling you of the clash.

.. option:: -R, --guid-mismatch-keep

    Perform a UID upgrade operation on GUID mismatch files.  Use this
    option if you think your index is corrupted rather than your
    message files, or if all backup attempts have failed and you're
    happy to be served the missing files.

.. option:: -U, --guid-mismatch-discard

    Use this option if you have corrupt message files in your spool and
    have been unable to restore them from backup.  This will make the
    mailbox IOERROR free and fix replication.

    WARNING:
    this deletes corrupt message files for ever - so make sure you've
    exhausted other options first!

.. option:: -o, --ignore-odd-files

    Ignore odd files in your mailbox disk directories, instead of
    complaining about them.  Probably useful if you are using some
    tool which adds additional tracking files.

.. option:: -O, --delete-odd-files

    Delete odd files.  This is the opposite of **-o**.

.. option:: -M, --prefer-mboxlist

    Prefer mailboxes.db over cyrus.header - will rewrite ACL or
    uniqueid from the mailboxes.db into the header file rather than the
    other way around.  |v3-new-feature|

.. option:: -V version, --set-version=version

    Change the ``cyrus.index`` minor version to a specific *version*.
    This can be useful for upgrades or downgrades. Use a magical
    version of *max* to upgrade to the latest available database format
    version.

.. option:: -u, --userids

    Instead of mailbox prefixes, give userids on the command line

.. option:: -P, --header-paths

    Instead of mailbox prefixes, give paths to cyrus.header files on
    the command line.  The paths can be mailbox directories, or
    explicit cyrus.header filenames.
    This will ONLY create/repair mailboxes.db records using data in
    cyrus.header and cyrus.index.
