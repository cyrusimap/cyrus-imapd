General cyrus inspection tool

Synopsis
========

.. parsed-literal::

    **cyr_info** [OPTIONS] conf
    **cyr_info** [OPTIONS] conf-default
    **cyr_info** [OPTIONS] conf-all
    **cyr_info** [OPTIONS] conf-lint
    **cyr_info** [OPTIONS] proc

Description
===========

**cyr_info** is a tool for getting information from Cyrus.  The intent
is to extend this tool with useful commands to make managing and
configuring Cyrus easier.

**cyr_info** |default-conf-text|

**cyr_info** provides the following sub-commands:

.. option:: conf

    Print the configuration options which have been set to a value
    other than their default, and their value.

    With **-s version**, configuration options whose behaviour has
    changed since *version* will be highlighted.

.. option:: conf-all

    Print ALL configuration options and their configured values (including
    those using their default value).  This command shows which options
    will be in effect at runtime.

    With **-s version**, configuration options which have been added or
    whose behaviour has changed since *version* will be highlighted.

.. option:: conf-default

    Print the default values for all available configuration options.

    With **-s version**, configuration options which have been added or
    whose behaviour has changed since *version* will be highlighted.

.. option:: conf-lint

    Print only configuration options which are NOT recognised.  This
    command should not print anything.  It uses cyrus.conf to find
    the names of configured services to avoid displaying any known
    configuration options for the named service.

.. option:: proc

    Print active processes that :cyrusman:`master(8)` is managing.

Options
=======

.. program:: cyr_info

.. option:: -C config-file

    |cli-dash-c-text|

.. option:: -M config-file

    Read service specifications from *config-file* (cyrus.conf format).

.. option:: -n name, --service=name

    Read the configuration as if for the service named *name*.

.. option:: -s version, --since=version

    Highlight configuration options that have been added or whose behaviour
    has been modified since *version*.  Use this option after a server upgrade,
    specifying your previous version, to find which options you need to review
    and maybe change before starting up the upgraded server.

    For use with the **conf**, **conf-all**, and **conf-default** sub-commands.
