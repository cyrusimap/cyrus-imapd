====================
Xapian for searching
====================

Cyrus can be configured to use `Xapian <http://xapian.org>`_ to power its searches.

Compiling Xapian for Cyrus
==========================

.. note::

    If CJK support is not required in your environment, you can use Cyrus with a
    standard upstream Xapian 1.4 release. Skip this section and move straight on to
    :ref:`Configuring Xapian <configuring-xapian>`. If you need CJK support, you will
    still need to use the third_party Xapian fork and compile from source.

The third\_party directory provides a pre-patched copy of 1.5-dev Xapian, ready for use with Cyrus. We are working on having the patches integrated upstream.

Compiling Xapian requires gcc 4.9 or later.

To build Xapian, build the third\_party packages which come with pre-patched Xapian and some other
dependencies. They are installed in ``/usr/local/cyruslibs`` by default unless overridden on the
command line.

.. code-block:: bash

    export CYRUSLIBS="/usr/local/cyruslibs"
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$CYRUSLIBS/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
    export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,$CYRUSLIBS/lib -Wl,-rpath,$CYRUSLIBS/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
    export PATH="$PATH:$CYRUSLIBS/bin"

    cd third_party
    sh build.sh $CYRUSLIBS_DIR

Then follow on with the Cyrus :ref:`compilation instructions <compiling>`, adding ``--enable-xapian`` to the flags to ``./configure``.

Additional dependencies required for Cyrus with Xapian support
==============================================================

When building Cyrus with Xapian support enabled, the following additional
packages are required:

* `rsync <https://rsync.samba.org>`_ (used when compacting databases)

.. _configuring-xapian:

Configuring Xapian
==================

Xapian requires a running :cyrusman:`squatter(8)` instance:

* In :cyrusman:`cyrus.conf(5)` set up a daemon squatter to run: ::

    DAEMON {
      # run a rolling squatter
      squatter cmd="squatter -R"
    }

* Enable sync logging: Set ``sync_log: on`` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`.
* Add a squatter sync log channel: ``sync_log_channels: squatter`` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`.

You also need (at least one) search tier. Add this to :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`.

::

    search_engine: xapian
    search_index_headers: no
    search_batchsize: 8192
    defaultpartition: base
    defaultsearchtier: t1
    partition-base: /var/cyrus/spool
    t1searchpartition-base: /var/cyrus/search
