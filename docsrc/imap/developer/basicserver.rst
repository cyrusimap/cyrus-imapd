======================
Running a basic server
======================

Once you have :ref:`compiled and installed Cyrus <imapinstallguide>`, you can configure your environment and start Cyrus.

At the end of this guide, you will be up and running with a local instance of Cyrus. It will have with basic incoming and outgoing mail flow, with CalDAV and CardDAV support.

.. note::
    These instructions are for Ubuntu 15.04. For other operating systems, dependency names in package managers may differ, but the main concepts remain the same.

    Please note that **this guide is meant to get you a working environment quickly, not to allow you to customize everything**.

    This guide will set up Cyrus to work with the Sendmail SMTP server - and there will be no instructions for using Postfix. Once you have a working environment, you are welcome to experiment further and set up a different MTA or use different kinds of authentication schemes, etc.


1. Update your system
----------------------

First update the system to ensure everything is current. This may take some time; you can check `Hacker News`_ in the meantime.

::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y

.. _Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/

2. Install Cyrus 3rd party dependencies
---------------------------------------

Install libraries and tools used by Cyrus IMAP. This includes a C compiler, some Perl libraries (used for Cyrus's command line utilities such as cyradm) or C clients for various databases (ie Mysql, Postgresql, etc). Just like the previous command, this one may take a few minutes to complete.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install -y autoconf automake autotools-dev bash-completion bison build-essential comerr-dev \
    debhelper flex g++ git gperf groff heimdal-dev libbsd-resource-perl libclone-perl libconfig-inifiles-perl \
    libcunit1-dev libdatetime-perl libdb-dev libdigest-sha-perl libencode-imaputf7-perl libfile-chdir-perl \
    libglib2.0-dev libical-dev libio-socket-inet6-perl libio-stringy-perl libjansson-dev libldap2-dev \
    libmysqlclient-dev libnet-server-perl libnews-nntpclient-perl libpam0g-dev libpcre3-dev libsasl2-dev \

    net-tools perl php5-cli php5-curl pkg-config po-debconf tcl-dev \
    transfig uuid-dev vim wamerican wget xutils-dev zlib1g-dev sasl2-bin rsyslog sudo acl telnet


3. The cyrus:mail user
----------------------

Now let's create a **special user account just for the Cyrus server** to sandbox Cyrus: called ``cyrus``. We'll also create a ``mail`` group as well. This allows Cyrus to give other programs some permissions if they are run under the ``mail`` group, again, without causing a Cyrus bug to delete all of your cat pictures. Disaster!

::

    groupadd -r mail
    useradd -c "Cyrus IMAP Server" -d /var/lib/imap -g mail -s /bin/bash -r cyrus

4. Setting up authentication with SASL
--------------------------------------

Now, let's set up **SASL**. This will allow you to connect to your local IMAP server and login, just like any IMAP user would before checking for new emails.

Create a ``saslauth`` group and add the ``cyrus`` user to the group, so Cyrus can access SASL. (on Debian, this group is called 'sasl': adjust the following commands to suit.)

::

    groupadd -r saslauth
    usermod -aG saslauth cyrus

Change the default SASL configuration in ``/etc/default/saslauthd``.
    1. Make sure that the ``START`` option is set to *yes* ``(START=yes)`` and
    2. Set the``MECHANISMS`` option to **sasldb** ``(MECHANISMS="sasldb")``.

Start the SASL auth daemon:

::

    /etc/init.d/saslauthd start

Now, we'll create the IMAP user inside SASL. This is the user you'll use to login to the IMAP server later on.

::

    echo 'secret' | saslpasswd2 -p -c imapuser

You can replace ``secret`` with a more suitable password you want and ``imapuser`` with the username you want. Once this is done, check that the user exists and is set up correctly:

::

    testsaslauthd -u imapuser -p secret

You should get an ``0: OK "Success."`` message.


5. Enabling mail delivery with LMTP
-----------------------------------

Your Cyrus IMAP server will want to receive the emails accepted by your SMTP server (ie Sendmail, Postfix, etc). In Cyrus, this happens via a protocol called LMTP, which is usually supported by your SMTP server.

Install Sendmail
################

We'll set up LMTP with the Sendmail SMTP server.

::

    sudo apt-get install -y sendmail

We need to make Sendmail aware of the fact we are using the Cyrus IMAP server: modify the ``/etc/mail/sendmail.mc`` file. Add this line before the ``MAILER_DEFINITIONS`` section:

::

    define(`confLOCAL_MAILER', `cyrusv2')dnl

And right below ``MAILER_DEFINITIONS``, add this:

::

    MAILER(`cyrusv2')dnl

This enables the **cyrusv2** mailer for local mail delivery. This is a sendmail property that tells sendmail it's talking to Cyrus. (Cyrus 3.x works with this property, despite the naming confusion.)

Next, we run a script that takes the ``/etc/mail/sendmail.mc`` file and and prepares it for use by Sendmail. This may take some time.

::

    sudo sendmailconfig

Sendmail communication
######################

One last thing we need to do for LMTP to work with Sendmail is to create a folder that will contain the UNIX socket used by Sendmail and Cyrus to deliver/receive emails:

::

    sudo mkdir -p /var/run/cyrus/socket
    sudo chown cyrus:mail /var/run/cyrus/socket
    sudo chmod 750 /var/run/cyrus/socket

6. Protocol ports
-----------------

.. include:: /imap/reference/admin/ports/services.rst
	:start-after: _imap-admin-ports-servent:
	:end-before: _imap-admin-ports-servent-end:

7. Configuring Cyrus
--------------------

(Nearly there)

Set up a simple directory structure for Cyrus to store emails, owned by the ``cyrus:mail`` account:

::

    sudo mkdir -p /var/imap /var/spool/imap
    sudo chown cyrus:mail /var/imap /var/spool/imap
    sudo chmod 750 /var/imap /var/spool/imap


Let's add some basic configuration for the Cyrus IMAP server. Two files have to be added: ``/etc/imapd.conf`` and ``/etc/cyrus.conf``.

For :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`, start with this:

::

    configdirectory: /var/imap
    partition-default: /var/spool/imap
    admins: imapuser
    sasl_pwcheck_method: saslauthd
    allowplaintext: yes
    virtdomains: yes
    defaultdomain: localhost

Note that **configdirectory** and **partition-default** are set to the folders we just created.

The admin user is the ``imapuser`` created in step 4, for authentication against sasl. Change this value if you named your user something different.

For :cyrusman:`cyrus.conf(5)`, start with this:

.. include:: /imap/reference/manpages/configs/cyrus.conf.rst
    :start-after: _imap-manpages-cyrus-conf:
    :end-before: _imap-manpages-cyrus-conf-end:

Before you launch Cyrus for the first time, create the Cyrus directory structure: use :cyrusman:`mkimap(8)`.

::

    sudo -u cyrus ./tools/mkimap

8. Launch Cyrus
---------------

::

    sudo ./master/master -d

Check ``/var/log/syslog`` for errors so you can quickly understand any problems.

When you're ready, you can create init scripts to start and stop your daemons. This
https://www.linux.com/learn/managing-linux-daemons-init-scripts is old, but has a good
explanation of the concepts required.

Optional: Setting up SSL certificates
-------------------------------------

Let's set up encryption with TLS. Create a TLS certificate using OpenSSL. Generate the certificate and store it in the /var/imap/server.pem file:

::

    sudo openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out /var/imap/server.pem \
    -keyout /var/imap/server.pem -days 365 \
    -subj "/C=US/ST=Denial/L=Springfield/O=Dis/CN=localhost"

This creates a TLS certificate (`-out`) and private key (`-keyout`) in the `X.509 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509>`_ format (`-x509`). The certificate is set to expire in 365 days (`-days`) and has default information set up (`-subj ...`). The contents of the -subj is non-trivial and defined in `RFC 5280 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt>`_, a brief summary is available on `stackoverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6464129/certificate-subject-x-509>`_ which is enough to decode our sample above.

Great! You should now have a file at /var/imap/server.pem. Give Cyrus access to this file:

::

    sudo chown cyrus:mail /var/imap/server.pem

Awesome! Almost done. We will now configure the Cyrus IMAP server to actually use this TLS certificate. Open your Cyrus configuration file /etc/imapd.conf and add the following to lines at the end of it:

::

    tls_server_cert: /var/imap/server.pem
    tls_server_key: /var/imap/server.pem

This tells the server where to find the TLS certificate and the key. It may seem weird to specify the same file twice, but since the file has the x509 format, the server will know what to do. Cyrus is there for you, always (unless your hard drive burns down) ! :-)

The other configuration file we have to edit is /etc/cyrus.conf. Open it up with your favorite text editor and in the **SERVICES** section, add this line:

::

    imaps        cmd="imapd" listen="imaps" prefork=0

Notice the `s` at the end of `imaps`. This says we are using TLS.

If you now restart (or start) your Cyrus server, you should have Cyrus listening on port **993** (the IMAPS port) with the **STARTTLS IMAP extension** enabled. You can check that TLS works as expected with the following command:

::

    imtest -t "" -u imapuser -a imapuser -w secret localhost

Make sure to replace `imapuser` with whatever user you set up with saslpasswd2 before, and to replace `secret` with the actual password you set for that user.

Sending a test email
--------------------

We will send a test email to our local development environment to check if:

* Sendmail accepts the incoming email,
* LMTP transmits the email to Cyrus IMAP,
* You can see the email stored on your filesystem.

But first, create a mailbox to send the test email to. We'll call this test mailbox `example@localhost`.

::

    echo 'createmailbox user/example@localhost' | cyradm -u imapuser -w secret localhost

We seem to be creating a mailbox named `user/example@localhost`. In fact, Cyrus understands this to be a user called `example@localhost`. As usual, adjust the password via the `-w` option to the password you set above.

If you have explicitly disabled `unixhierarchysep` in `/etc/imapd.conf` (it is enabled by default in 3.0+), you should replace `user/example@localhost` with `user.example@localhost`. You can read more about unixhierarchysep in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`.

The command will produce the following output:

::

    localhost> localhost>

This happens because cyradm is normally used interactively, with a prompt. We aren't using a prompt, so this output is expected.

Now that the mailbox exists, we can send an email using telnet with raw SMTP commands.

First, connect to the Sendmail SMTP server:

::

    telnet localhost smtp

You should see a prompt appear:

::

    Trying ::1...
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    220 ... ESMTP Sendmail ...

Now, we'll send the `SMTP commands <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt>`_ to the server. These are responsible for ordering Sendmail to store an email:

::

    EHLO localhost
    MAIL FROM:<hello@localhost>
    RCPT TO:<example@localhost>
    DATA
    Hello world!
    .
    QUIT

If you are using Sendmail as your SMTP server, you should be able to safely copy and paste this bit into the terminal before hitting your ENTER key. If not, you may want to paste these commands one by one (or make sure you enable `PIPELINING` in the SMTP config).

If you see a message like **250 2.0.0 ... Message accepted for delivery**, you did it! You should now have a file called `1.` in the `/var/spool/imap/user/example` directory, with the content of the email you sent just before.

If not, you may want to check `syslog` to see if any error messages show up and go through the previous steps again.

To let the example user log in via IMAP on a normal mail client, you need to add them to SASL (as before)::

    echo 'mypassword' | saslpasswd2 -p -c example

Check your two users are there::

    sasldblistusers2

You can now configure a mail client to access your new mailserver and connect to the mailbox for example@localhost via IMAP and see the message.

Checking CardDAV and CardDAV
----------------------------

Modify ``/etc/cyrus.conf`` and add this line to the services::

    http        cmd="httpd" listen="http" prefork=0

Modify ``/etc/imapd.conf`` and add this line::

    httpmodules: caldav carddav


Running the following commands should return you sample entry addressbook and calendar entry for the sample example user::

    curl -u example@[hostname]:mypassword -i -X PROPFIND -H 'Depth: 1' http://localhost:8080/dav/addressbooks/user/example@[hostname]/Default

    curl -u example@[hostname]:mypassword -i -X PROPFIND -H 'Depth: 1' http://localhost:8080/dav/principals/user/example@[hostname]/

Troubleshooting
---------------

Some common issues are explained below.

I have all kinds of weird Perl errors when running cyradm
#########################################################

The solution is to set the Perl library path right. To be honest, I was too lazy to figure out exactly which path was right, so I added this snippet to my ``~/.bashrc`` file:

::

    export PERL5LIB="$PERL5LIB:$(find path/to/cyrus/perl -type d | tr "\\n" ":")"

Just make sure to change **path/to/cyrus** to the actual path to the Cyrus source code directory. This should be something like ``/home/jack/cyrus-src/perl``.

I can't connect to the IMAP server
##################################

Make sure that the SASL auth daemon is running. You can start it with this command:

::

    /etc/init.d/saslauthd start

You can safely run this command even if you don't know whether the SASL auth daemon is already running or not.

Emails are not being delivered to Cyrus
#######################################

Make sure that you have started Sendmail, which you can do like this:

::

    /etc/init.d/sendmail start

My IMAP server (master) can't authenticate users to SASL
########################################################

Check that the groups setting on your cyrus user is correct.

Ubuntu uses `saslauth` group, Debian uses `sasl` group.

Check the output of `groups cyrus` to see what groups it currently belongs to.

Incorrect groups settings results in saslauthd reporting permission failures::

    SASL cannot connect to saslauthd server: Permission denied
    SASL unable to open Berkeley db /etc/sasldb2: Permission denied

Master will need to be restarted if you needed to change the groups.

Something is not working but I can't figure out why
###################################################

More information is almost always logged to **syslog**. Make sure you start syslog with this command before starting the Cyrus server:

::

    /etc/init.d/rsyslog start

My question isn't answered here
