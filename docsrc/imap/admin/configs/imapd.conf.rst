IMAP configuration file

DESCRIPTION
===========

    **/etc/imapd.conf**
    is the configuration file for the Cyrus IMAP server.  It defines
    local parameters for IMAP.

    Each line of the **/etc/imapd.conf** file has the form
        *option*: *value*

    where *option* is the name of the configuration option being set
    and *value* is the value that the configuration option is being
    set to.

    Although there is no limit to the length of a line, a \`\`\\''
    (backslash) character may be used as the last character on a line to
    force it to continue on the next one.  No additional whitespace is
    inserted before or after the \`\`\\''.  Note that a line that is split
    using \`\`\\'' character(s) is still considered a single line.

    For example
        *option*:\\

         *value*\ 1 *value*\ 2 \\

          *value*\ 3

    is equivalent to
        *option*: *value*\ 1 *value*\ 2   *value*\ 3

    Blank lines and lines beginning with \`\`#'' are ignored.

    For boolean and enumerated options, the values \`\`yes'', \`\`on'', \`\`t'',
    \`\`true'' and \`\`\ 1'' turn the option on, the values \`\`no'', \`\`off'',
    \`\`f'', \`\`false'' and \`\`\ 0'' turn the option off.

FIELD DESCRIPTIONS
==================


    The sections below detail options that can be placed in the
    **/etc/imapd.conf** file, and show each option's default value.
    Some options have no default value, these are listed with
    \`\`<no default>''.  Some options default to the empty string, these
    are listed with \`\`<none>''.


    .. startblob addressbookprefix

    ``addressbookprefix:`` #addressbooks

        The prefix for the addressbook mailboxes hierarchies.  The hierarchy
        delimiter will be automatically appended.  The public addressbook
        hierarchy will be at the toplevel of the shared namespace.  A
        user's personal addressbook hierarchy will be a child of their Inbox. 

    .. endblob addressbookprefix

    .. startblob admins

    ``admins:`` <empty string>

        The list of userids with administrative rights.  Separate each userid
        with a space.  Sites using Kerberos authentication may use
        separate "admin" instances.

        Note that accounts used by users should not be administrators.
        Administrative accounts should not receive mail.  That is, if user
        "jbRo" is a user reading mail, he should not also be in the admins line.
        Some problems may occur otherwise, most notably the ability of
        administrators to create top-level mailboxes visible to users,
        but not writable by users. 

    .. endblob admins

    .. startblob afspts_localrealms

    ``afspts_localrealms:`` <none>

        The list of realms which are to be treated as local, and thus stripped
        during identifier canonicalization (for the AFSPTS ptloader module).
        This is different from loginrealms in that it occurs later in the
        authorization process (as the user id is canonified for PTS lookup) 

    .. endblob afspts_localrealms

    .. startblob afspts_mycell

    ``afspts_mycell:`` <none>

        Cell to use for AFS PTS lookups.  Defaults to the local cell. 


    .. endblob afspts_mycell

    .. startblob allowallsubscribe

    ``allowallsubscribe:`` 0

        Allow subscription to nonexistent mailboxes.  This option is
        typically used on backend servers in a Murder so that users can
        subscribe to mailboxes that don't reside on their "home" server.
        This option can also be used as a workaround for IMAP clients which
        don't play well with nonexistent or unselectable mailboxes (e.g.,
        Microsoft Outlook). 

    .. endblob allowallsubscribe

    .. startblob allowanonymouslogin

    ``allowanonymouslogin:`` 0

        Permit logins by the user "anonymous" using any password.  Also
        allows use of the SASL ANONYMOUS mechanism. 

    .. endblob allowanonymouslogin

    .. startblob allowapop

    ``allowapop:`` 1

        Allow use of the POP3 APOP authentication command.

        Note that this command requires that SASL is compiled with APOP
        support, that the plaintext passwords are available in a SASL auxprop
        backend (e.g., sasldb), and that the system can provide enough entropy
        (e.g., from /dev/urandom) to create a challenge in the banner. 

    .. endblob allowapop

    .. startblob allownewnews

    ``allownewnews:`` 0

        Allow use of the NNTP NEWNEWS command.

        Note that this is a very expensive command and should only be
        enabled when absolutely necessary. 

    .. endblob allownewnews

    .. startblob allowplaintext

    ``allowplaintext:`` 0

        If enabled, allows the use of cleartext passwords on the wire.

        By default, the use of cleartext passwords requires a TLS/SSL
        encryption layer to be negotiated prior to any cleartext
        authentication mechanisms being advertised or allowed.  To require a
        TLS/SSL encryption layer to be negotiated prior to ANY
        authentication, see the *tls_required* option. 

    .. endblob allowplaintext

    .. startblob allowusermoves

    ``allowusermoves:`` 0

        Allow moving user accounts (with associated meta-data) via RENAME
        or XFER.

        Note that measures should be taken to make sure that the user being
        moved is not logged in, and cannot login during the move.  Failure
        to do so may result in the user's meta-data (seen state,
        subscriptions, etc) being corrupted or out of date. 

    .. endblob allowusermoves

    .. startblob altnamespace

    ``altnamespace:`` 0

        Use the alternate IMAP namespace, where personal folders reside at the
        same level in the hierarchy as INBOX.

        This option ONLY applies where interaction takes place with the
        client/user.  Currently this is limited to the IMAP protocol (imapd)
        and Sieve scripts (lmtpd).  This option does NOT apply to admin tools
        such as cyradm (admins ONLY), reconstruct, quota, etc., NOR does it
        affect LMTP delivery of messages directly to mailboxes via
        plus-addressing. 

    .. endblob altnamespace

    .. startblob altprefix

    ``altprefix:`` Alt Folders

        Alternative INBOX spellings that can't be accessed in altnamespace
        otherwise go under here 

    .. endblob altprefix

    .. startblob annotation_db

    ``annotation_db:`` twoskip

        The cyrusdb backend to use for mailbox annotations. 

        Allowed values: *skiplist*, *twoskip*


    .. endblob annotation_db

    .. startblob annotation_db_path

    ``annotation_db_path:`` <none>

        The absolute path to the annotations db file.  If not specified,
        will be confdir/annotations.db 

    .. endblob annotation_db_path

    .. startblob anyoneuseracl

    ``anyoneuseracl:`` 1

        Should non-admin users be allowed to set ACLs for the 'anyone'
        user on their mailboxes?  In a large organization this can cause
        support problems, but it's enabled by default. 

    .. endblob anyoneuseracl

    .. startblob annotation_allow_undefined

    ``annotation_allow_undefined:`` 0

        Allow clients to store values for entries which are not
        defined either by Cyrus or in the annotations_definitions
        file. 

    .. endblob annotation_allow_undefined

    .. startblob annotation_definitions

    ``annotation_definitions:`` <none>

        File containing external (third-party) annotation definitions.

        Each line of the file specifies the properties of an annotation and
        has the following form:

            *name*, *scope*, *attrib-type*, *proxy-type*,
            *attrib-names*, *acl*

        *name*
            is the hierarchical name as in :rfc:`5257` or :rfc:`5464` (in the latter case,
            without the leading **/shared** or **/private**).  For example,
            /vendor/acme/blurdybloop.

        *scope*
            specifies whether the annotation is for the **server**, a
            **mailbox**, or a **message**.

        *attrib-type*
                specifies the attribute data type, which is used only to check the
                string value passed by clients when setting annotations.  The
                *attrib-type* is one of:

            **string**
                any value is accepted.

            **content-type**
                this obsolete data type, which was useful for early drafts of the standard,
                is accepted but silently translated to **string**.

            **boolean**
                only the strings "true" or "false" are accepted.  Checking is
                case-insensitive but the value is forced to lowercase.

            **int**
                integers are accepted.

            **uint**
                non-negative integers are accepted.


        *proxy-type*
            specifies whether this attribute is for the **backend** or
            **proxy** servers or both (**proxy_and_backend**)

        *attrib-names*
            is the space-separated list of available attributes for the
            annotation. Possible attribute names are **value.shared**,
            **value.priv**, and **value** (which permits both **value.priv**
            and **value.shared**).  The attribute names **size**,
            **size.shared**, and **size.priv** are accepted but ignored; these
            attributes are automatically provided by the server if the corresponding
            **value** attribute is specified.  Some obsolete attributes, which were
            defined early drafts of the standard, are accepted and ignored with a
            warning.

        *extra-permissions*
            is the extra ACL permission bits required for setting this annotation, in
            standard IMAP ACL permission bit string format.  Note that this is
            in addition to the permission bits specified in :rfc:`5257` and :rfc:`5464`,
            so leaving this field empty is harmless.  Note also that there is no way
            to specify that an annotation can only be set by an admin user; in
            particular the **a** permission bit does not achieve this.

            Blank lines and lines beginning with \`\`#'' are ignored.


    .. endblob annotation_definitions

    .. startblob annotation_callout

    ``annotation_callout:`` <none>

        The pathname of a callout to be used to automatically add annotations
        or flags to a message when it is appended to a mailbox.  The path can
        be either an executable (including a script), or a UNIX domain
        socket.  

    .. endblob annotation_callout

    .. startblob aps_topic

    ``aps_topic:`` <none>

        Topic for Apple Push Service registration. 


    .. endblob aps_topic

    .. startblob archive_enabled

    ``archive_enabled:`` 0

        Is archiving enabled for this server.  You also need to have an
        archivepartition for the mailbox.  Archiving allows older email
        to be stored on slower, cheaper disks - even within the same
        mailbox, as distinct from partitions. 

    .. endblob archive_enabled

    .. startblob archive_days

    ``archive_days:`` 7

        The number of days after which to move messages to the archive partition
        if archiving is enabled 

    .. endblob archive_days

    .. startblob archive_maxsize

    ``archive_maxsize:`` 1024

        The size in kilobytes of the largest message that won't be archived
        immediately.  Default is 1Mb 

    .. endblob archive_maxsize

    .. startblob archive_keepflagged

    ``archive_keepflagged:`` 0

        If set, messages with the \\Flagged system flag won't be archived,
        provided they are smaller than **archive_maxsize**. 

    .. endblob archive_keepflagged

    .. startblob archivepartition-name

    ``archivepartition-name:`` <none>

        The pathname of the archive partition *name*, corresponding to
        spool partition **partition-name**.  For any mailbox residing in
        a directory on **partition-name**, the archived messages will be
        stored in a corresponding directory on **archivepartition-name**.
        Note that not every **partition-name** option is strictly required
        to have a corresponding **archivepartition-name** option, but that
        without one there's no benefit to enabling archiving. 

    .. endblob archivepartition-name

    .. startblob auditlog

    ``auditlog:`` 0

        Should cyrus output log entries for every action taken on a message
        file or mailboxes list entry?  It's noisy so disabled by default, but
        can be very useful for tracking down what happened if things look strange 

    .. endblob auditlog

    .. startblob auth_mech

    ``auth_mech:`` unix

        The authorization mechanism to use. 

        Allowed values: *unix*, *pts*, *krb*, *krb5*


    .. endblob auth_mech

    .. startblob autocreateinboxfolders

        Deprecated in favor of *autocreate_subscribe_folders*. 


    .. endblob autosubscribeinboxfolders

    .. startblob autosubscribesharedfolders

    ``autosubscribesharedfolders:`` <none>

    .. endblob autosubscribesharedfolders

    .. startblob autosubscribe_all_sharedfolders

    ``autosubscribe_all_sharedfolders:`` 0

    .. endblob autosubscribe_all_sharedfolders

    .. startblob autocreate_inbox_folders

    ``autocreate_inbox_folders:`` <none>

        If a user does not have an INBOX already, and the INBOX is to be
        created, create the list of folders in this setting as well.
        *autocreate_inbox_folders* is a list of INBOX's subfolders
        separated by a "|", that are automatically created by the server
        under the following two scenarios. Leading and trailing whitespace is
        stripped, so "Junk | Trash" results in two folders: "Junk" and
        "Trash".

        INBOX folders are created under both the following conditions:

        1.
            The user logins via the IMAP or the POP3 protocol.
            *autocreate_quota* option must have a value of zero or greater.

        2.
            A message arrives for the user through the *lmtpd(8)*.
            *autocreate_post* option must be enabled.



    .. endblob autocreate_inbox_folders

    .. startblob autocreate_post

    ``autocreate_post:`` 0

        If enabled, when *lmtpd(8)* receives an incoming mail for an
        INBOX that does not exist, then the INBOX is automatically created
        by *lmtpd(8)* and delivery of the message continues. 

    .. endblob autocreate_post

    .. startblob autocreate_quota

    ``autocreate_quota:`` -1

        If set to a value of zero or higher, users have their INBOX folders
        created upon a successful login event or upon *lmtpd(8)*
        message delivery if *autocreate_post* is enabled, provided their
        INBOX did not yet already exist.

        The user's quota is set to the value if it is greater than zero,
        otherwise the user has unlimited quota.

        Note that quota is specified in kilobytes. 

    .. endblob autocreate_quota

    .. startblob autocreate_quota_messages

    ``autocreate_quota_messages:`` -1

        If set to a value of zero or higher, users who have their INBOX
        folders created upon a successful login event (see
        *autocreate_quota*), or upon *lmtpd(8)* message delivery if
        *autocreate_post* is enabled, receive the message quota
        configured in this option.

        The default of -1 disables assigning message quota.

        For consistency with *autocreate_quota*, a value of zero is treated
        as unlimited message quota, rather than a message quota of zero. 

    .. endblob autocreate_quota_messages

    .. startblob autocreate_sieve_folders

    ``autocreate_sieve_folders:`` <none>

        A "|" separated list of subfolders of INBOX that will be
        automatically created, if requested by a sieve filter, through the
        "fileinto" action. The default is to create no folders
        automatically.

        Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from each folder, so a
        setting of "Junk | Trash" will create two folders: "Junk" and
        "Trash". 

    .. endblob autocreate_sieve_folders

    .. startblob autocreate_sieve_script

    ``autocreate_sieve_script:`` <none>

        The full path of a file that contains a sieve script. This script
        automatically becomes a user's initial default sieve filter script.

        When this option is not defined, no default sieve filter is created.
        The file must be readable by the Cyrus daemon. 

    .. endblob autocreate_sieve_script

    .. startblob autocreate_sieve_script_compile

    ``autocreate_sieve_script_compile:`` 0

        If set to yes and no compiled sieve script file exists, the sieve script which is
        compiled on the fly will be saved in the file name that autocreate_sieve_compiledscript
        option points to. In order a compiled script to be generated, autocreate_sieve_script and
        autocreate_sieve_compiledscript must have valid values 

    .. endblob autocreate_sieve_script_compile

    .. startblob autocreate_sieve_script_compiled

    ``autocreate_sieve_script_compiled:`` <none>

        The full path of a file that contains a compiled in bytecode sieve script. This script
        automatically becomes a user's initial default sieve filter script.  If this option is
        not specified, or the filename doesn't exist then the script defined by
        autocreate_sieve_script is compiled on the fly and installed as the user's default
        sieve script 

    .. endblob autocreate_sieve_script_compiled

    .. startblob autocreate_subscribe_folders

    ``autocreate_subscribe_folders:`` <none>

        A list of folder names, separated by "|", that the users get automatically subscribed to,
        when their INBOX is created. These folder names must have been included in the
        autocreateinboxfolders option of the imapd.conf. 

    .. endblob autocreate_subscribe_folders

    .. startblob autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders

    ``autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders:`` <none>

        A list of shared folders (bulletin boards), separated by "|", that the users get
        automatically subscribed to, after their INBOX is created. The shared folder must
        have been created and the user must have the required permissions to get subscribed
        to it. Otherwise, subscribing to the shared folder fails. 

    .. endblob autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders

    .. startblob autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders_all

    ``autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders_all:`` 0

        If set to yes, the user is automatically subscribed to all shared folders, one has permission
        to subscribe to. 

    .. endblob autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders_all

    .. startblob autocreate_users

    ``autocreate_users:`` anyone

        A space separated list of users and/or groups that are allowed their INBOX to be
        automatically created. 

    .. endblob autocreate_users

    .. startblob backuppartition-name

    ``backuppartition-name:`` <none>

        The pathname of the backup partition *name*.  At least one backup
        partition pathname MUST be specified if backups are in use.  Note that
        there is no relationship between spool partitions and backup partitions. 

    .. endblob backuppartition-name

    .. startblob backup_compact_minsize

    ``backup_compact_minsize:`` 0

        The minimum size in kilobytes of chunks in each backup.  The compact tool
        will try to combine adjacent chunks that are smaller than this.

        Setting this value to zero or negative disables combining of chunks. 

    .. endblob backup_compact_minsize

    .. startblob backup_compact_maxsize

    ``backup_compact_maxsize:`` 0

        The maximum size in kilobytes of chunks in each backup.  The compact tool
        will try to split chunks larger than this into smaller chunks.

        Setting this value to zero or negative disables splitting of chunks. 

    .. endblob backup_compact_maxsize

    .. startblob backup_compact_work_threshold

    ``backup_compact_work_threshold:`` 1

        The number of chunks that must obviously need compaction before the compact
        tool will go ahead with the compaction.  If set to less than one, the value
        is treated as being one. 

    .. endblob backup_compact_work_threshold

    .. startblob backup_staging_path

    ``backup_staging_path:`` <none>

        The absolute path of the backup staging area.  If not specified,
        will be temp_path/backup 

    .. endblob backup_staging_path

    .. startblob backup_retention_days

    ``backup_retention_days:`` 7

        The number of days to keep content in backup after it has been deleted
        from the source.  If set to a negative value or zero, deleted content
        will be kept indefinitely. 

    .. endblob backup_retention_days

    .. startblob backup_db

    ``backup_db:`` twoskip

        The cyrusdb backend to use for the backup locations database. 

        Allowed values: *skiplist*, *sql*, *twoskip*


    .. endblob backup_db

    .. startblob backup_db_path

    ``backup_db_path:`` <none>

        The absolute path to the backup db file.  If not specified,
        will be confdir/backups.db 

    .. endblob backup_db_path

    .. startblob boundary_limit

    ``boundary_limit:`` 1000

        messages are parsed recursively and a deep enough MIME structure
        can cause a stack overflow.  Do not parse deeper than this many
        layers of MIME structure.  The default of 1000 is much higher
        than any sane message should have. 

    .. endblob boundary_limit

    .. startblob caldav_allowattach

    ``caldav_allowattach:`` 1

        Enable managed attachments support on the caldav server.

    .. startblob expunge_mode

    ``expunge_mode:`` delayed

        The mode in which messages (and their corresponding cache entries)
        are expunged.  "default" mode is the default behavior in which the
        message files are purged at the time of the EXPUNGE, but index
        and cache records are retained to facilitate QRESYNC.  In "delayed"
        mode, the message files are also retained, allowing unexpunge to
        rescue them.  In "immediate" mode, both the message files and the
        index records are removed as soon as possible.  In all cases,
        nothing will be finally purged until all other processes have
        closed the mailbox to ensure they never see data disappear under
        them.  In "default" or "delayed" mode, a later run of "cyr_expire"
        will clean out the retained records (and possibly message files).
        This reduces the amount of I/O that takes place at the time of
        EXPUNGE and should result in greater responsiveness for the client,
        especially when expunging a large number of messages.

        By default, lmtpd will be strict (per :rfc:`2821`) with regards to which
        envelope addresses are allowed.  If this option is set to false, 8bit
        characters in the local-part of envelope addresses are changed to 'X'
        instead.  This is useful to avoid generating backscatter with

    .. startblob newsaddheaders

    ``newsaddheaders:`` to

        Space-separated list of headers to be added to incoming usenet
        articles.  Added *To:* headers will contain email
        delivery addresses corresponding to each newsgroup in the
        *Newsgroups:* header.  Added *Reply-To:* headers will
        contain email delivery addresses corresponding to each newsgroup in

    .. startblob newsgroups

    ``newsgroups:`` \*

        A wildmat pattern specifying which mailbox hierarchies should be
        treated as newsgroups.  Only mailboxes matching the wildmat will
        accept and/or serve articles via NNTP.  If not set, a default

        translated to "<newsprefix>.\*" 

    .. endblob newsgroups

    .. startblob newsmaster

    ``newsmaster:`` news

        Userid that is used for checking access controls when executing
        Usenet control messages.  For instance, to allow articles to be
        automatically deleted by cancel messages, give the "news" user
        the 'd' right on the desired mailboxes.  To allow newsgroups to be
        automatically created, deleted and renamed by the corresponding
        control messages, give the "news" user the 'c' right on the desired
        mailbox hierarchies. 

    .. endblob newsmaster

    .. startblob newspeer

    ``newspeer:`` <none>

        A list of whitespace-separated news server specifications to which
        articles should be fed.  Each server specification is a string of
        the form [user[:pass]@]host[:port][/wildmat] where 'host' is the fully
        qualified hostname of the server, 'port' is the port on which the
        server is listening, 'user' and 'pass' are the authentication
        credentials and 'wildmat' is a pattern that specifies which groups
        should be fed.  If no 'port' is specified, port 119 is used.  If
        no 'wildmat' is specified, all groups are fed.  If 'user' is specified
        (even if empty), then the NNTP POST command will be used to feed
        the article to the server, otherwise the IHAVE command will be
        used.


        A '@' may be used in place of '!' in the wildmat to prevent feeding
        articles cross-posted to the given group, otherwise cross-posted
        articles are fed if any part of the wildmat matches.  For example,
        the string "peer.example.com:\*,!control.\*,@local.\*" would feed all
        groups except control messages and local groups to
        peer.example.com.  In the case of cross-posting to local groups,
        these articles would not be fed. 

    .. endblob newspeer

    .. startblob newspostuser

    ``newspostuser:`` <none>

        Userid used to deliver usenet articles to newsgroup folders

        to "post+comp.mail.imap" would be delivered to the "comp.mail.imap"
        folder.


        When set, the Cyrus NNTP server will add the header(s) specified in
        the **newsaddheaders** option to each incoming usenet article.
        The added header(s) will contain email delivery addresses
        corresponding to each relevent newsgroup.  If not set, no headers
        are added to usenet articles.

            each partition is weighted according to its free space (%); the more free space
            the partition has, the more chances it has to be selected

        *freespace-percent-weighted-delta*
            each partition is weighted according to its difference of free space (%)
            compared to the most used partition; the more the partition is lagging behind
            the most used partition, the more chances it has to be selected

            Note that actually even the most used partition has a few chances to be
            selected, and those chances increase when other partitions get closer

    .. startblob plaintextloginpause

    ``plaintextloginpause:`` 0

        Number of seconds to pause after a successful plaintext login.  For
        systems that support strong authentication, this permits users to
        perceive a cost of using plaintext passwords.  (This does not
        affect the use of PLAIN in SASL authentications.) 

    .. endblob plaintextloginpause

    ``popexpiretime:`` -1

        The number of days advertised as being the minimum a message may be
        left on the POP server before it is deleted (via the CAPA command,
        defined in the POP3 Extension Mechanism, which some clients may
        support).  "NEVER", the default, may be specified with a negative
        number.  The Cyrus POP3 server never deletes mail, no matter what
        the value of this parameter is.  However, if a site implements a
        less liberal policy, it needs to change this parameter
        accordingly. 

    .. endblob popexpiretime

    .. startblob popminpoll

    .. startblob popsubfolders

    ``popsubfolders:`` 0

        userid+subfolder syntax as the authentication/authorization id. 

    .. endblob popsubfolders

    .. startblob poppollpadding

    ``poppollpadding:`` 1

        Create a softer minimum poll restriction.  Allows *poppollpadding*
        connections before the minpoll restriction is triggered.  Additionally,
        one padding entry is recovered every *popminpoll* minutes.
        This allows for the occasional polling rate faster than popminpoll,
        (i.e., for clients that require a send/receive to send mail) but still
        enforces the rate long-term.  Default is 1 (disabled).


        The easiest way to think of it is a queue of past connections, with one
        slot being filled for every connection, and one slot being cleared
        every *popminpoll* minutes. When the queue is full, the user
        will not be able to check mail again until a slot is cleared.  If the
        user waits a sufficient amount of time, they will get back many or all
        of the slots. 

    .. endblob poppollpadding

    .. endblob poptimeout

    .. startblob popuseacl

    ``popuseacl:`` 0

        Enforce IMAP ACLs in the pop server.  Due to the nature of the POP3
        protocol, the only rights which are used by the pop server are 'r',
        't', and 's' for the owner of the mailbox.  The 'r' right allows the
        user to open the mailbox and list/retrieve messages.  The 't' right
        allows the user to delete messages.  The 's' right allows messages
        retrieved by the user to have the \\Seen flag set (only if
        *popuseimapflags* is also enabled). 

    .. endblob popuseacl

    .. startblob popuseimapflags

    ``popuseimapflags:`` 0

        If enabled, the pop server will set and obey IMAP flags.  Messages
        having the \\Deleted flag are ignored as if they do not exist.
        Messages that are retrieved by the client will have the \\Seen flag
        set.  All messages will have the \\Recent flag unset.

    ``proxyd_allow_status_referral:`` 0

        Set to true to allow proxyd to issue referrals to clients that support it
        when answering the STATUS command.  This is disabled by default since
        some clients issue many STATUS commands in a row, and do not cache the
        connections that these referrals would cause, thus resulting in a higher
        authentication load on the respective backend server.

    .. startblob sasl_option

    ``sasl_option:`` 0

        Any SASL option can be set by preceding it with **sasl_**.  This

    .. endblob sasl_option

    .. startblob sasl_pwcheck_method

    ``sasl_pwcheck_method:`` <none>

        The mechanism used by the server to verify plaintext passwords.
        Possible values include "auxprop", "saslauthd", and "pwcheck".

    ``search_normalisation_max:`` 1000

        A resource bound for the combinatorial explosion of search expression
        tree complexity caused by normalising expressions with many OR nodes.
        These can use more CPU time to optimise than they save IO time in scanning
        folders. 

    .. endblob search_normalisation_max

    .. startblob search_engine

    ``search_engine:`` none

        The indexing engine used to speed up searching.

    ``search_index_headers:`` 1

        Whether to index headers other than From, To, Cc, Bcc, and Subject.
        Experiment shows that some headers such as Received and DKIM-Signature
        can contribute up to 2/3rds of the index size but almost nothing to
        the utility of searching.  Note that is header indexing is disabled,
        headers can still be searched, the searches will just be slower.


    .. endblob search_index_headers

    ``search_skipdiacrit:`` 1

        When searching, should diacriticals be stripped from the search
        terms.  The default is "true", a search for "hav" will match
        "Håvard".  This is not :rfc:`5051` complient, but it backwards
        compatible, and may be preferred by some sites. 

    .. endblob search_skipdiacrit

    .. startblob search_skiphtml

    ``search_skiphtml:`` 0

        If enabled, HTML parts of messages are skipped, i.e. not indexed and
        not searchable.  Otherwise, they're indexed.  

    .. endblob search_skiphtml

    .. startblob search_whitespace

    ``search_whitespace:`` merge

        When searching, how whitespace should be handled.  Options are:
        "skip" (default in 2.3 and earlier series) - where a search for
        "equi" would match "the quick brown fox".  "merge" - the default,
        where "he  qu" would match "the quick   brownfox", and "keep",
        where whitespace must match exactly.  The default of "merge" is
        recommended for most cases - it's a good compromise which
        keeps words separate. 
        Allowed values: *skip*, *merge*, *keep*


    .. endblob search_whitespace

        If all backends are over that limit, this feature is not used anymore.


    .. endblob serverlist_select_soft_usage_limit

    .. startblob servername

    ``servername:`` <none>

        This is the hostname visible in the greeting messages of the POP,
        IMAP and LMTP daemons. If it is unset, then the result returned
        from gethostname(2) is used.  This is also the value used by murder
        clusters to identify the host name.  It should be resolvable by
        DNS to the correct host, and unique within an active cluster.  If
        you are using low level replication (e.g. drbd) then it should be
        the same on each copy and the DNS name should also be moved to
        the new master on failover.

    .. endblob anysievefolder

    .. startblob singleinstancestore

    ``singleinstancestore:`` 1

        If enabled, imapd, lmtpd and nntpd attempt to only write one copy
        of a message per partition and create hard links, resulting in a
        potentially large disk savings. 

    .. endblob singleinstancestore

    .. startblob skiplist_always_checkpoint

    ``skiplist_always_checkpoint:`` 1

        If enabled, this option forces the skiplist cyrusdb backend to
        always checkpoint when doing a recovery.  This causes slightly
        more IO, but on the other hand leads to more efficient databases,
        and the entire file is already "hot". 

    .. endblob skiplist_always_checkpoint

    .. startblob skiplist_unsafe

    ``skiplist_unsafe:`` 0

        If enabled, this option forces the skiplist cyrusdb backend to

    .. endblob skiplist_unsafe

    .. startblob soft_noauth

    ``soft_noauth:`` 1

        If enabled, lmtpd returns temporary failures if the client does not

        Name of the service (or port number) of the replication service on
        replica host.  Prefix with a channel name to only apply for that
        channel.  If not specified, the replication client will first
