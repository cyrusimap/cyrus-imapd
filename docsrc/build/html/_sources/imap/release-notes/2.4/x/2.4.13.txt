Cyrus IMAP 2.4.13 Release Notes
===============================

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.4.12

*   Bug #3565 - fix gcc compiler warnings - thanks Dilyan Palauzov <dilyan.palauzov@aegee.org>
*   Bug #2685 - rename annots in delayed folder delete. Avoids annotations "reappearing" when a folder is recreated
*   Bug #3566 - actually fix in a backward compatible way. 2.4.12 broke older versions of bison
*   Lots of small cleanups from CMU as they prepared to build RSS into their 2.4 build. Thanks Ken
*   Bug #3591/#3609 - fix crash in mupdate on partition move
*   Bug #3610 - fix replication of partition move
*   Bug #3564 - document the way prefork interacts with multiple network protocols
*   Bug #3586 - allow rename of "\\Noselect" if subfolders exist
*   A handful of small cleanups (#3593, #3594, #3595) from David Carter <dpc22@cam.ac.uk>. Very much appreciated
*   Disabled duplicate_check DEBUG level log messages by default. Thanks Philip Prindeville <philipp@redfish-solutions.com>
*   Bug #3608 - log mailbox name in more sync failure cases
*   Bug #3615 - fix proxyd_disable_mailbox_referrals. Thanks Andrew Morgan <morgan@orst.edu>
*   Bug #3611 - fix crash in sync_mailbox_full if expunge fails
*   Backported some nice fixes from master, including safer thread/sort (there were some crashes on bad messages before)
*   Fixed infinite loop on suppress_capabilities with substrings of other capabilities. Ouch.
*   Fixed LIST and LSUB again - this time to make LIST "" "\*%" work without breaking other things
*   Bug #3588 - make XFER not break if the wrong server name was used. The start of making murder safer
*   Bug #3603 - tidied up usage of kick_mupdate so it never gets called on standard murder backends
*   Bug #3604 - always suppress the ``DELETED.*`` mailbox names, even if delete_mode is immediate. It means a config change or different frontend won't show undeletable mailboxes
*   Bug #3602 - allow UpperCase in service names to work
