Cyrus Roadmap
=============

This is a very general, high-level view of where the Cyrus project is heading
in the future, and the amount of code support you may expect to receive if
you're running an older version of Cyrus.

This is under your control! If there's a feature you'd like to see added, or
testing/documentation you'd like to see improved, we'd love to have your
involvement to help make it happen. We're here to support you.
:ref:`Contact us <support>` and take a look at the
:ref:`Contributor guides <contribute>`.

High Level Roadmap
==================

Future
------

* Continued enhancement to JMAP Email, Calendars, and Contacts
* Improved internals for prioritizing JMAP
* Simplification of internals, with fewer (and better) ways to do things
* Improved developer experience

..
	This is woefully out of date.
