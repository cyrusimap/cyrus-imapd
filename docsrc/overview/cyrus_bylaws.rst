=============
Cyrus Bylaws
=============

To better facilitate the governance and to ensure the future of the Cyrus Project, we have established these bylaws under which the Project will be managed.

I. The Cyrus Governance Board
-----------------------------

The Cyrus Governance Board is responsible for the overall direction of the Cyrus project. Members of the board are nominated by the Cyrus community at large. Following nomination, a vote must be called by a current member of the board. A nominated member must be elected by a simple 2/3 majority vote of the current Board. There is no upper limit to the number of members of the Board. An existing member may be removed from the board by resigning, or by a unanimous vote of the remaining members of the board.

The Board is comprised of:

* Bron Gondwana
* Ken Murchison
* Ricardo Signes

II. The Cyrus Core Developers Group
-----------------------------------

The Cyrus Core Developers Group is responsible for the technical guidance of the Cyrus project. Members are nominated by the Cyrus developer community. Following nomination, a vote must be called by a current Core Developer. A nominated member must be elected by a simple 2/3 majority of the current Core Developers Group, then confirmed by a simple 2/3 majority of the Governance Board.

The members of the Core Developers group are:

* Alexey Melnikov
* Bron Gondwana
* Ken Murchison
* Matt Selsky

III. The Release Engineer
-------------------------

The Release Engineer is responsible for making Cyrus releases. The Release Engineer is also responsible for committing contributions from non-committers in the absence of anyone accepting the responsibility for a particular issue. The Release Engineer must be elected by a simple 2/3 majority of the Core Developers Group, then confirmed by a simple 2/3 majority of the Governance Board.

The release engineer is:

* ellie timoney

IV. Development Process
----------------------

Significant new features or changes to existing code should be discussed on the cyrus-dev mailing list prior to beginning development to allow feedback from other developers. Once a solution has been proposed and accepted by rough consensus of the developers, coding should proceed. All patches must be submitted through the bug tracking system. Once submitted to the tracking system, a member of the core developers group must review the code. If there are no objections to the patch by the core developers, the core developer should then commit the code to the source repository. The submitter of the code is responsible for ensuring that the code gets reviewed by the core developers. Submitters may inquire as to the status of their patches to either the Release Engineer or CORE no more than once per week. Accepted patches will be included in the next appropriate release.

The Release Engineer shall make regular releases. If there are no blocker-level bugs, a release may be made at the Release Engineer's discretion. The Release Engineer may also classify a bug as blocker or as a security fix that requires immediate release.

The Core Developers group may block a pending release with a simple majority vote.

V. Changes to the Bylaws
-------------------------

A simple 2/3 majority vote of the current Governance Board is required to change the bylaws.
