The pathname of the archive partition ``name``, corresponding to
spool partition **partition-name**.  For any mailbox residing in
a directory on **partition-name**, the archived messages will be
stored in a corresponding directory on **archivepartition-name**.
Note that not every **partition-name** option is strictly required
to have a corresponding **archivepartition-name** option, but that
without one there's no benefit to enabling archiving.
