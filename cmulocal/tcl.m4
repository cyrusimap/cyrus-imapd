dnl tcl.m4: an autoconf Tcl locator
dnl
dnl This is rob's Tcl macro, fixed by tjs.  It may need occasional tweaking,
dnl but until the next impediment to compilation, it's fill-in-the-blank,
dnl and it should be able to do reasonable things with user input.
dnl
dnl This will probably just work on Andrew systems, but given the variety
dnl and apparent creativity of people who compile Tcl elsewhere, I don't know
dnl what it will do.  I have yet to see an autoconf Tcl test that users were
dnl happy with.
dnl
dnl BUGS
dnl   The command-line arguments are overcomplicated.
dnl   There are doubtlessly others...

dnl To use this macro, just do CMU_TCL.  It outputs
dnl TCL_LIBS, TCL_CPPFLAGS, and TCL_DEFS and SUBSTs them.
dnl If successful, these have stuff in them.  If not, they're empty.
dnl If not successful, with_tcl has the value "no".

AC_DEFUN([CMU_TCL], [
# --- BEGIN CMU_TCL ---
dnl To link against Tcl, configure does several things to make my life
dnl "easier".
dnl
dnl * maybe ask the user where they think Tcl lives, and try to find it
dnl * maybe ask the user what "tclsh" is called this week (i.e., "tclsh8.0")
dnl * run tclsh, ask it for a path, then run that path through sed
dnl * sanity check its result (many installs are a little broken)
dnl * try to figure out where Tcl is based on this result
dnl * try to guess where the Tcl include files are

dnl > XXX MUST CHECK FOR TCL BEFORE KERBEROS V4 XXX
dnl > This is because some genius at MIT named one of the Kerberos v4
dnl > library functions log().  This of course conflicts with the
dnl > logarithm function in the standard math library, used by Tcl.
dnl
dnl > Checking for Tcl first puts -lm before -lkrb on the library list.
