This is a collection of autoconf macros which've been written by
various people at CMU.  To use it, use "aclocal -I cmulocal".

CMU_ADD_LIBPATH
  Add -L(arg), and possibly -R(arg) (or whatever the runpath is) to
  LDFLAGS.

CMU_ADD_LIBPATH_TO
  Likewise to above, except adds it to the specified variable (arg 2).

CMU_GUESS_RUNPATH_SWITCH
  Attempts to guess what the runpath switch is (-R or whatever).
