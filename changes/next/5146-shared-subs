Description:

* Fixed :issue:`5146`: can't subscribe to shared mailbox when username is a
  prefix of owner's username


Config changes:

None


Upgrade instructions:

No manual intervention required.

Subscriptions databases will be upgraded the next time they're opened, and any
bad entries due to the bug will be found and fixed.  You can force this for a
particular user by connecting to IMAP as them and issuing a command like
``. LSUB "" "*"`` or similar, but this will happen anyway during normal usage.
