Increased granularity of Prometheus report frequency configuration.


Config changes:

The Prometheus usage report will be turned off by default after upgrade.
This means that the "cyrus_usage_..." metrics will no longer be reported.
To turn this back on, set prometheus_usage_update_freq to a suitable duration.
