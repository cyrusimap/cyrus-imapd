Description:

Update mboxlist group: ACL handling to change raclmodseq

This adds the 'raclmodseq' command as well, which is used by tests to
check that RACLs are updated as expected, and probably won't be used
by anything else!


Config changes:

No config changes - if reverseacls are enabled, they'll also work with
group: acls now.


Upgrade instructions:

No config changes

GitHub issue:

No github issue.
