Description:

Mailboxes and user metadata directories names by UUID rather than by name.


Config changes:

'reverseuniqueids' is deprecated and unused (reverse UNIQUEID records are now standard)


Upgrade instructions:

1. Shutdown Cyrus.
2. Backup mailboxes.db
3. Install new Cyrus binaries.
4. Startup Cyrus (ctl_cyrusdb -r will upgrade mailboxes.db)
5. Use relocate_by_id to move users/mailboxes to UUID directories at your leisure.
