the mailboxes.db

adds 'vnd.cmu.visibleUsers' to event_extra_params


Upgrade instructions:

No changed needed - but you can use the mboxgroups backend if you want.

The new capability 'XUSERGROUPS' will appear in imapd, and admins will
get the new commands GETUSERGROUP, SETUSERGROUP, and UNSETUSERGROUP.
