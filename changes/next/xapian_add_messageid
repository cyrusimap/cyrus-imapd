Description:

Adds JMAP Email/query filter conditions `messageId`, `references` and `inReplyTo`.

Config changes:

None.


Upgrade instructions:

It is recommended to rebuild the Xapian index to make use of these filter
conditions. Otherwise, email queries having these filter fall back to
reading the MIME headers from disk, resulting in slower search.


GitHub issue:

None.
