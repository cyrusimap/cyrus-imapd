Description:

Adds the 'vnd.cmu.jmapEmail' selector to the 'event_extra_params' option
which will includes a JMAP Email object in the event message.

Config changes:

The 'vnd.cmu.jmapEmail' selector to the 'event_extra_params' can be
more parser friendly than vnd.cmu.envelope and includes the same data,
plus the emailId and threadId. 


Upgrade instructions:

When adding 'vnd.cmu.jmapEmail' it would make sense to remove all of
'vnd.cmu.envelope', 'vnd.cmu.emailid', and 'vnd.cmu.threadid' as these
would add redundant data to the event message.
