Description:

add 'replicaonly' config option that blocks all non-silent writes

(Silent writes are those where the modseq is specified in the write,
so the highestmodseq doesn't get increased - these are the sort done
by sync_server)

Config changes:

the boolean config option `replicaonly` (default: false) can be set
to mark a server as only being a replica.  This will stop calalarmd
from doing anything, and also deny any non-silent writes.


Upgrade instructions:

No change required - you can keep running without setting this config
option on replicas, and they will behave as before (in particular,
you will still have to make sure not to run calalarmd on replicas).

GitHub issue:

none
