Description:

Touch file to suppress calalarmd processing


Config changes:

Creates a new option: `caldav_alarm_suppress_file`, default null.
If configured, calalarmd will check for this file before processing
alarms, and skip this run while the file is present.


Upgrade instructions:

You don't need to do anything.  You can set this if you want to be able to
pause calalarmd at times.
