Description:

Documentation now uses the theme from Read the Docs rather than the old
custom one.


Config changes:

None


Upgrade instructions:

If you wish to (re)build the documentation, you will need to have the python
module "sphinx_rtd_theme" available.  On Debian, this is in the
python3-sphinx-rtd-theme package.
