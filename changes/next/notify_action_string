Description:

Sieve notifications no longer include the "actions string".


Config changes:

None required.


Upgrade instructions:

Generally, none required.  In the unlikely event that you required
notifications sent by Sieve to include the list of exact actions taken so far,
you may need to update that the expectations of downstream software.


GitHub issue:

None.
