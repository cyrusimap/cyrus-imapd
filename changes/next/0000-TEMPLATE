Submitting a PR?  Create a file in this directory with the same name as your
branch, and add the following details (you can use this file as a template).

Description:

A one line-ish description of the feature, for the release notes.


Config changes:

If your PR changes lib/imapoptions at all, list which options you've changed
here.  They should be documented in the source, so this can just be a list.
This is also the place to call out changes to how cyrus.conf is parsed, if
your PR does that.


Upgrade instructions:

What will an admin need to do when upgrading to a Cyrus version that has
this feature?  What will they need to do when enabling this feature?
This might be things like "upgrade mailboxes to at least version x", or
"reconstruct with this flag", or "rebuild conversations db", or "rebuild
search indexes", or "add an xyz job to cyrus.conf", ... etc.


GitHub issue:

If theres a github issue number for this, put it here.
