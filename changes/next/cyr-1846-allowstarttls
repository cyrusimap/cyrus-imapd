Description:

The industry is deprecating STARTTLS in favor of implicit TLS over a
dedicated port.  This PR disables opportunistic TLS by default.


Documentation:

imapd.conf(5)


Config changes:

Added the 'allowstarttls' option, which when enabled, allows upgrading a
plaintext connection to use TLS.


Upgrade instructions:

Installations that need to service clients that use opportunistic TLS
should enable the 'allowstarttls' option, or a protocol specific 'allowstarttls'
option, E.g. 'imap_allowstarttls'.
