Description:

Add a way to freeze an entire server temporarily while taking snapshots or
similar.


Config changes:

Adds a new config switch `global_lock` - if true (the default) then a new
global shared lock is taken before any exclusive lock is taken, and held
until all global locks are released - meaning that any command which wishes
to take a consistent snapshot can use the `cyr_withlock_run` command.

Whether or not this setting is enabled, you can also use
`cyr_withlock_run --user` to run a command with a single user locked.


Upgrade instructions:

There are no operational changes required; it just works once you're running
the new version.
