.SH DESCRIPTION
.I imtest
is a utility that allows you to authenticate to a IMAP or IMSP server
and interactively issue commands to it. Once authenticated you may
issue any IMAP or IMSP command by simply typing it in. It is capable
of multiple SASL authentication mechanisms and handles encryption
layers transparently. This utility is often used for testing the
operation of a imsp or imap server. Also those developing IMAP clients
find it useful.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-t " keyfile"
Enable TLS.  \fIkeyfile\fR contains the TLS public and private keys.
Specify \fB""\fR to not use TLS authentication.
.TP
.BI \-p " port"
Port to connect to. If left off this defaults to \fBimap\fR as defined in
/etc/services. 
.TP
.BI -m " mechanism"
Force imtest to use \fImechanism\fR for authentication. If not specified
the strongest authentication mechanism supported by the server is
chosen.  Specify \fBlogin\fR to use the LOGIN command instead of AUTHENTICATE.
.TP
.BI -u " user"
Username to use for authentication; defaults to the current user.
.TP
.BI -a " user"
Authname to use for authentication; defaults to the current user.
.TP
.BI -k " num"
Minimum protection layer required.
.TP
.BI -l " num"
Maximum protection layer to use (\fB0\fR=none; \fB1=\fRintegrity;
etc).  For example if you are using the KERBEROS_V4 authentication
mechanism specifying \fB0\fR will force imtest to not use any layer
and specifying \fB1\fR will force it to use the integrity layer.  By
default the maximum supported protection layer will be used.
.TP
.BI -r " realm"
Specify the \fIrealm\fR to use. Certain authentication mechanisms
(e.g. DIGEST-MD5) may require one to specify the realm.
.TP
.BI -f " file"
Pipe \fIfile\fR into connection after authentication.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose. Print out more information than usual.
.TP
.B -z
Timing test.
