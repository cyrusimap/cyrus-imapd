  SQUAT library public interface.
  Robert O'Callahan

  SQUAT (Search QUery Answer Tool) is a library for full-text indexing
  and searching.

  The primary design goals are simplicity and robustness. There are
  two parts to the API:
  -- Indexing: Build an index by feeding in a set of documents
     composed of arbitrary binary text.
  -- Searching: Specify an arbitrary substring (of length >=
     SQUAT_WORD_SIZE, default 4) and return a superset of the
     documents which contain the substring. (SQUAT can (and
     occasionally does) return documents which do not match the
     string, thus the documents must be searched 'by hand' after
     obtaining a document list from SQUAT.)

  SQUAT provides the following features that other similar engines do not:
  -- Simple generic API (see above). No "word" heuristics to tweak. No
     confusion about what can or cannot be matched. This makes SQUAT
     suitable for indexing non-English, non-ASCII documents.
  -- Simple, robust design. SQUAT has a very small amount of code. It
     has been engineered for robustness; arbitrary input documents are
     allowed, and corrupt index files are always be detected and
     handled by SQUAT (i.e., it should never crash or behave
     unpredictably). Anything less is a bug.
  -- Robust performance. SQUAT searches are always fast. SQUAT index
     creation uses a two-pass algorithm that consumes little memory
     even for very large document collections and runs in time linear
     in the combined size of the documents.
  -- Easy embedding. The simple C library API makes it easy to add
     SQUAT index creation and searching functionality to existing
     applications without the need for helper processes or
     tools. SQUAT's robustness makes it safe to do so.

  NOTES:

  SQUAT is not thread safe. Make sure that only one thread is in SQUAT
  code at a time.

  Arbitrary binary substring searching is often not what you want for
  your application. Most users will want to canonicalize the indexed
  text and/or queries before feeding them into SQUAT, for example by
  converting to a uniform case, or by converting runs of whitespace to
  a single space. Such conversions are the responsibility of the
  client.

  Minimal index size is *not* a goal of SQUAT. SQUAT tries to build
  small indices but does not use techniques such as aggregation of
  small documents (blocking) or aggressive file compression. The main
  reason for this is to keep the code simple and robust. Another
  reason is that disk is cheap. (Of course, one could perform blocking
  at the client level to feed approximately equal size documents into
  SQUAT, which would reduce index size and possibly make searches
  faster if the application needs to find the location of the search
  text and/or verify the search match within each document.) In
  practice I find that, indexing my email, the indexes are about the
  size as the processed source text, which is about 1/3 of the total
  size of my email (since Cyrus' processing strips whitespace, binary
  attachments, etc).

  The index file format is platform and architecture independent. The
  file format supports 64-bit file offsets so in theory >2GB index
  files would work, but the code has not been tested on any 64-bit
  architectures (64 bit addressing would be needed to mmap such
  files), so >2GB index files probably don't work in practice.
