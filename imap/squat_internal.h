  SQUAT internal utility functions and definitions, used only by other
  SQUAT components.

  IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

  In the following, I assume that SQUAT_WORD_SIZE has its default value of 4.

  For each 'word' (string of 4 consecutive bytes) occurring in the
  source documents, the SQUAT index records which documents the word
  occurs in. To search for an arbitrary string of K >= 4 bytes, SQUAT
  computes the set of documents which contain all K-3 words that the
  substring contains.

  For example, if we search for "a kitty", SQUAT will return every
  document which contains each of the substrings "a ki", " kit",
  "kitt", and "itty". Obviously every document containing "a kitty"
  also contains those substrings, but other documents may be returned
  which do not contain "a kitty". (For example, the document "a killer
  kitty" would also be returned.) However, experiments on an email
  corpus seem to show that such false matches are very uncommon.

  The index contains three main data structures. There is a doc-list
  structure which simply records the name and size of each source
  document. Each entry in this structure has variable length; it is
  designed to be traversed sequentially by squat_search_list_docs.

  There is a doc-ID-list structure which is an array, indexed by the
  doc-ID, of offsets to the doc-list element for that doc-ID. This is
  designed to allow for efficient recovery of the name of a document
  given its ID.

  The rest of the file is a trie, describing the documents containing
  each words. Each trie is exactly 3 levels deep, indexed by the first
  three characters of each word. Each leaf of a trie is a list of
  lists of documents, one list of documents per last character of a
  word. The 256-way branch tables within the tries, and the document
  lists, are stored using mildly clever encodings to reduce space
  consumption.

  The file contains SQUAT_SAFETY_ZONE (currently 16) zero bytes at the
  end. They are there to stop runaway decoding loops from segfaulting;
  these loops can assume the bytes are there, scan away with
  guaranteed termination, and then detect errors after the fact. We
  check that these safety bytes are there and zero when we open an
  index for reading!

  Any words containing any 'invalid characters' as specified by the
  index creator are simply dropped from the index. The invalid
  characters are recorded so that clients can get a meaningful error
  if they try to perform a search using those characters (otherwise
  they'd just get no documents returned).

/* Index file format

   "I" means an unsigned integer decoded as N bytes as follows:
     The low 7 bits of each byte encode the integer (most significant byte
     first). The high 8th bit of the first N-1 bytes is 1 and the high 8th bit
     of the Nth byte is 0.
   "N" means a null-terminated UTF8 string.
   "8" means an 8-bit byte.
   "32" means a 32-bit signed integer in big-endian format.
   "64" means a 64-bit signed integer in big-endian format.

   K = SQUAT_WORD_SIZE-1

   <doc-ID-list> = 32"doc-ID-offset"* 0 0 0 0

   <doc-list> = <document-info>* 0
   <document-info> = S"name" I"length"

   <word-list> = <word-list-trie-1>* <trie-index>
   <trie-index> = <present-bits> I<subtrie-backwards-offset>*
   <present-bits> = 8"singleton"
                  | 8"start-byte" 8"count-bytes-minus-one" 8"present-bytes"*
   <word-list-trie-1> = <word-list-trie-2>* <trie-index>
   ...

   <word-trie-info> = <index-run>"documents"
   <index-run> = I"adjusted-single-index"
               | I"adjusted-run-size" <index-run-list>*
   <index-run-list> = I"adjusted-single-index-delta"
                    = I"adjusted-run-length" I"first-index-delta"

   The adjusted-single-index is the actual index shifted left one bit with the
   bottom bit set to 1.
   The adjusted-run-size is the actual run size (in bytes) shifted left one
   bit with the bottom bit set to 0.
   The adjusted-single-index-delta is the actual index shifted left one bit
   with the bottom bit set to 1.
   The adjusted-run-length is the length of the run of consecutive indices
   shifted left one bit with the bottom bit set to 0.

   The last SQUAT_SAFETY_ZONE bytes of the index file must be 0.
   This helps protect us against corrupt index files.
