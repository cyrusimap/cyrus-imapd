/* Sendmail has some weird ideas on what constitutes permenant failure.  On
   more than one occasion, we have gotten burned by this moving users around
   through various inadvisable means, screwing up the mailboxes file,
   whatever.

   We don't want to fail out permenantly on things like EX_USAGE, EX_SOFTWARE,
   etc., because that generally means someone was just screwing with the mail
   store and we don't want to lose mail.

   Instead, we map these EC_* codes to EX_* codes, thereby lying to Sendmail,
   since we don't derive any benefit from Sendmail knowing what the error was.
   We just want it to retry all the time anyway.  This way, should sendmail's
   behavior be different and we start deriving benefit from Sendmail knowing
   stuff, we can easily change it back.

   So other code uses the EC_* error, then we maybe change it to TEMPFAIL if
   we don't agree on whether the error should be permenant or not.
