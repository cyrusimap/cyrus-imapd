.SH NAME
imapd.conf \- IMAP configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR
is the configuration file for the Cyrus IMAP server.  It defines
local parameters for IMAP.
.PP
Each line of the \fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR file has the form
.IP
\fIoption\fR: \fIvalue\fR
.PP
where \fIoption\fR is the name of the configuration option being set
and \fIvalue\fR is the value that the configuration option is being
set to.
.PP
Although there is no limit to the length of a line, a ``\\''
(backslash) character may be used as the last character on a line to
force it to continue on the next one.  No additional whitespace is
inserted before or after the ``\\''.  Note that a line that is split
using ``\\'' character(s) is still considered a single line.
For example
.IP
\fIoption\fR:\\
.br
.in +1
\fIvalue\fR1 \fIvalue\fR2 \\
.br
.in +1
\fIvalue\fR3
.PP
is equivalent to
.IP
\fIoption\fR: \fIvalue\fR1 \fIvalue\fR2   \fIvalue\fR3
.PP
Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.
.PP
For boolean and enumerated options, the values ``yes'', ``on'', ``t'',
``true'' and ``1'' turn the option on, the values ``no'', ``off'',
``f'', ``false'' and ``0'' turn the option off.
.SH FIELD DESCRIPTIONS
.PP
The sections below detail options that can be placed in the
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR file, and show each option's default value.
Some options have no default value, these are listed with
``<no default>''.  Some options default to the empty string, these
are listed with ``<none>''.
*/

# OPTIONS

{ "addressbookprefix", "#addressbooks", STRING }
/* The prefix for the addressbook mailboxes hierarchies.  The hierarchy
   delimiter will be automatically appended.  The public addressbook
   hierarchy will be at the toplevel of the shared namespace.  A
   user's personal calendar hierarchy will be a child of their Inbox. */

{ "admins", "", STRING }
/* The list of userids with administrative rights.  Separate each userid
   with a space.  Sites using Kerberos authentication may use
   separate "admin" instances.
.PP
   Note that accounts used by users should not be administrators.
   Administrative accounts should not receive mail.  That is, if user
   "jbRo" is a user reading mail, he should not also be in the admins line.
   Some problems may occur otherwise, most notably the ability of
   administrators to create top-level mailboxes visible to users,
   but not writable by users. */

{ "afspts_localrealms", NULL, STRING }
/* The list of realms which are to be treated as local, and thus stripped
   during identifier canonicalization (for the AFSPTS ptloader module).
   This is different from loginrealms in that it occurs later in the
   authorization process (as the user id is canonified for PTS lookup) */

{ "afspts_mycell", NULL, STRING }
/* Cell to use for AFS PTS lookups.  Defaults to the local cell. */

{ "allowallsubscribe", 0, SWITCH }
/* Allow subscription to nonexistent mailboxes.  This option is
   typically used on backend servers in a Murder so that users can
   subscribe to mailboxes that don't reside on their "home" server.
   This option can also be used as a workaround for IMAP clients which
   don't play well with nonexistent or unselectable mailboxes (e.g.,
   Microsoft Outlook). */

{ "allowanonymouslogin", 0, SWITCH }
/* Permit logins by the user "anonymous" using any password.  Also
   allows use of the SASL ANONYMOUS mechanism. */

{ "allowapop", 1, SWITCH }
/* Allow use of the POP3 APOP authentication command.
.PP
  Note that this command requires that SASL is compiled with APOP
  support, that the plaintext passwords are available in a SASL auxprop
  backend (e.g., sasldb), and that the system can provide enough entropy
  (e.g., from /dev/urandom) to create a challenge in the banner. */

{ "allownewnews", 0, SWITCH }
/* Allow use of the NNTP NEWNEWS command.
.PP
  Note that this is a very expensive command and should only be
  enabled when absolutely necessary. */

{ "allowplaintext", 0, SWITCH }
/* Allow the use of cleartext passwords on the wire. */

{ "allowusermoves", 0, SWITCH }
/* Allow moving user accounts (with associated meta-data) via RENAME
   or XFER.
.PP
  Note that measures should be taken to make sure that the user being
  moved is not logged in, and cannot login during the move.  Failure
  to do so may result in the user's meta-data (seen state,
  subscriptions, etc) being corrupted or out of date. */

{ "altnamespace", 0, SWITCH }
/* Use the alternate IMAP namespace, where personal folders reside at the
   same level in the hierarchy as INBOX.
.PP
   This option ONLY applies where interaction takes place with the
   client/user.  Currently this is limited to the IMAP protocol (imapd)
   and Sieve scripts (lmtpd).  This option does NOT apply to admin tools
   such as cyradm (admins ONLY), reconstruct, quota, etc., NOR does it
   affect LMTP delivery of messages directly to mailboxes via
   plus-addressing. */

{ "annotation_db", "twoskip", STRINGLIST("skiplist", "twoskip")}
/* The cyrusdb backend to use for mailbox annotations. */

{ "annotation_db_path", NULL, STRING }
/* The absolute path to the annotations db file.  If not specified,
   will be confdir/annotations.db */

{ "anyoneuseracl", 1, SWITCH }
/* Should non-admin users be allowed to set ACLs for the 'anyone'
   user on their mailboxes?  In a large organization this can cause
   support problems, but it's enabled by default. */

{ "annotation_allow_undefined", 0, SWITCH }
/* Allow clients to store values for entries which are not
   defined either by Cyrus or in the annotations_definitions
   file. */

{ "annotation_definitions", NULL, STRING }
/* File containing external (third-party) annotation definitions.
.PP
Each line of the file specifies the properties of an annotation and
has the following form:
.IP
\fIname\fR, \fIscope\fR, \fIattrib-type\fR, \fIproxy-type\fR,
\fIattrib-names\fR, \fIacl\fR
.\"
.IP \fIname\fR 5
is the hierarchical name as in RFC 5257 or RFC 5464 (in the latter case,
without the leading \fB/shared\fR or \fB/private\fR).  For example,
/vendor/acme/blurdybloop.
.\"
.IP \fIscope\fR 5
specifies whether the annotation is for the \fBserver\fR, a
\fBmailbox\fR, or a \fBmessage\fR.
.\"
.IP \fIattrib-type\fR 5
.RS 5
specifies the attribute data type, which is used only to check the
string value passed by clients when setting annotations.  The
\fIattrib-type\fR is one of:
.\"
.IP \fBstring\fR 5
any value is accepted.
.\"
.IP \fBcontent-type\fR 5
this obsolete data type, which was useful for early drafts of the standard,
is accepted but silently translated to \fBstring\fR.
.\"
.IP \fBboolean\fR 5
only the strings "true" or "false" are accepted.  Checking is
case-insensitive but the value is forced to lowercase.
.\"
.IP \fBint\fR 5
integers are accepted.
.\"
.IP \fBuint\fR 5
non-negative integers are accepted.
.\"
.RE
.\"
.IP \fIproxy-type\fR 5
specifies whether this attribute is for the \fBbackend\fR or
\fBproxy\fR servers or both (\fBproxy_and_backend\fR)
.\"
.IP \fIattrib-names\fR 5
is the space-separated list of available attributes for the
annotation. Possible attribute names are \fBvalue.shared\fR,
\fBvalue.priv\fR, and \fBvalue\fR (which permits both \fBvalue.priv\fR
and \fBvalue.shared\fR).  The attribute names \fBsize\fR,
\fBsize.shared\fR, and \fBsize.priv\fR are accepted but ignored; these
attributes are automatically provided by the server if the corresponding
\fBvalue\fR attribute is specified.  Some obsolete attributes, which were
defined early drafts of the standard, are accepted and ignored with a
warning.
.\"
.IP \fIextra-permissions\fR 5
is the extra ACL permission bits required for setting this annotation, in
standard IMAP ACL permission bit string format.  Note that this is
in addition to the permission bits specified in RFC 5257 and RFC 5464,
so leaving this field empty is harmless.  Note also that there is no way
to specify that an annotation can only be set by an admin user; in
particular the \fBa\fP permission bit does not achieve this.
.PP
Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.
