This is the Carnegie Mellon University Cyrus IMAP Server.

The 2.5 series contains numerous features and better standards
support than previous versions.

No further development work will progress on anything older than
version 2.2.  Versions 2.2 and 2.3 still receive security updates,
but new features or non-security bugfixes are unlikely to be
backported.

If you continue to install this software PLEASE be sure to read the
documentation (located in the doc/ subdirectory).  Many common questions
can be answered just by carefully following the documentation.
Please also refer to https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-imapd/issues

Note that CMU only provides a source distribution. If you run into
problems with any binary distribution, please contact the source of
