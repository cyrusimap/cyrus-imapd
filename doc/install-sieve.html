<h1>Installing Sieve
</h1>
<body>

<p>This section assumes that you compiled Cyrus with sieve support. If
you specified <tt>--disable-sieve</tt> when running
<tt>./configure</tt>, you did NOT compile the server with sieve
support. 

<p>A <a href="http://www.cyrusoft.com/sieve">brief introduction</a> to
Sieve at is available from <a href="http://www.cyrusoft.com/">Cyrusoft
International</a>.

<h3>Configure outgoing mail</h3>

<p>Some Sieve actions (redirect, vacation) can send outgoing mail.</p>

<p>You'll need to make sure that "<tt>lmtpd</tt>" can send outgoing
messages.  Currently, it invokes "<tt>/usr/lib/sendmail</tt>" by
default to send messages.  Change this by adding a line like:

<pre>
   sendmail: /usr/sbin/sendmail
</pre>

in your "<tt>/etc/imapd.conf</tt>".  If you're using Postfix or another
MTA, make sure that the sendmail referenced in
"<tt>/etc/imapd.conf</tt>" is Sendmail-compatible.</p>

<h3>Managing Sieve Scripts</h3>

Since Cyrus is based around the concept of a sealed-server, the normal
way for users to manipulate Sieve scripts is through the
"<tt>installsieve</tt>" utility.

<p>If, for some reason, you do have user home directories on the
server, you can use the "<tt>sieveusehomedir</tt>" option and have the
sieve script stored in the home directory of the user as
"<tt>~/.sieve</tt>".

<h3>Testing the sieve server</h3>
<ol>

<p>
<li>The Sieve server, "<tt>timsieved</tt>", is used for transporting
user Sieve scripts to the sealed IMAP server.  It is incompatible with
the "<tt>sieveusehomedir</tt>" option.  It is named after the
principal author, Tim Martin, who desperately wanted something named
after him in the Cyrus distribution.

<p>
<li>From your normal account, telnet to the sieve port on the
server you're setting up:

<pre>
<kbd>   telnet foobar sieve
</kbd></pre>

If your server is running, you'll get a message similar to the following one:

<pre>
   Trying 128.2.10.192...
   Connected to foobar.andrew.cmu.edu.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   "CMU Experimental Sieved version 0.99" "SASL={GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS, PLAIN, KERBEROS_V4}"
</pre>

<p>
Any message other than one similar to the one above means there is a
problem. Make sure all of authentication methods you wish to support
are listed. This list should be identical to the one listed by
"<tt>imapd</tt>" earlier. Next terminate the connection, by typing
    "<kbd>logout</kbd>".

<p>
<li>Next test authenticating to the sieve server. To do this run the
"<tt>installsieve</tt>" utility. You must specify the server. You may
have to specify the port if you run this utility from a different
machine without the "sieve" entry in "<tt>/etc/services</tt>". To
specify the port use the "<tt>-p [port]</tt>" switch.

<pre>
  "<kbd>installsieve foobar</kbd>"
</pre>

This should produce the message "<tt>Authentication failed</tt>" with
a description of the failure if there was a problem.

<p><li>Next you should attempt to place a sieve script on the
server. To do this create a file named "<tt>myscript.script</tt>" with
the following lines. Replace "<tt>foo@example.org</tt>" with an email
address you can send mail from, but that is not the one you are
working on now.

<pre>
  require ["reject","fileinto"];

  if address :is :all "From" "foo@example.org"
  {
    reject "testing";
  }
</pre>

To place this script on the server run the following command

"<kbd>installsieve -i myscript.script foobar</kbd>"

This should place your script on the server and make it the active script.

<p>
<li>Test that the sieve script is actually run from deliver. Send
a message to the address you're working on from the address mentioned
in the sieve script. The message should be rejected.

</ol>
