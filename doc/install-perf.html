<h1>Performance Notes</h1>

Performance issues for you to consider. If you never expect to have
more than 100 simultaneous users, chances are any hardware you have
will be fine. If you plan on having thousands or more users, please
be sure to review this section. 

<p>If your configuration directory is not <tt>/var/imap</tt>,
adjust accordingly.</p>

<ul>
<li><tt><b>/var/imap/proc</b></tt> - After a successful login, the
imapd creates a file in <tt>/var/imap/proc</tt> that is its unix
process id. It also contains the name of any <tt>SELECT</tt>'d
mailbox. The file is deleted when the user logs out. 

<p>Given the potential load, this is a good candidate to move
elsewhere. This can be done by symlink'ing the directory to another
partition. We symlink it to a directory on a memory/viritual memory
filesystem (specifically Solaris' tmpfs). If you use a tmpfs type
filesystem, make sure that you have sufficient memory/swap to do
this.</p>

<p>Some people don't care about this information and just #ifdef
out the code. We probably should add a <tt>configure</tt> option to
do this.</p>
</li>

<li><tt><b>/var/imap/deliverdb</b></tt> - Unless you disable
duplicate delivery suppression, each time a mail message is
delivered it needs to lock the database and check to see if the
message-id has been seen already. If you require really high
throughput delivery, you may want to disable this feature. However,
disabling this feature also disables Sieve support. 

<p>We run with it enabled and it doesn't significantly impact our
performance.</p>
</li>

<li><tt><b>/var/spool/mqueue</b></tt> - Sendmail can be pretty
harsh on the spool partition. Having this on a separate disk is
usually a good idea. Consider using LMTP and delivering from a
separate machine.</li>

<li>Unused SASL mechanisms - If you just build the SASL library and
copied all the mechanisms into /usr/lib/sasl2, the <tt>imapd</tt>
will try to use them and allocate some amount of memory. In
general, the operating system will swap out those pages but you may
be allocating more swap space than you need. So, look in
/usr/lib/sasl2 and if you don't plan on using those mechanisms,
don't leave them there.</li>

<li>You may want to increase the listen queue value when starting
up the master process. For example, you may want to do this if you
see the Listen queue drop counter increasing quickly. For example,
under Solaris, look at the variable tcpListenDrop (from <tt>netstat
-sP tcp</tt>).</li>

<li><b>Database recovery.</b> If restarting the server takes a long
time due to the <tt>cyrusdb</tt> database recovery procedure (this is
usually true if you have a large number of deliveries) you should look
into shortening the interval between checkpoints, controlled by the
<tt>cyrusdb</tt> event in <tt>/etc/cyrus.conf</tt>.  We run
checkpoints every 5 minutes; the current suggested install interval
is 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, there's no magic bullet for performance. It depends
on your hardware, your operating system, and how your users use the
system. In general, an <tt>imapd</tt> process takes up anywhere
from 256 Kbytes of memory to 512 Kbytes when it is first fired up.
CPU has not been a big deal, but it may become more important as
the imap sessions are encrypted and now that searching may be more
frequent. Disk I/O is probably the most important and having a
hardware RAID subsystem with an amount of write-back cache would be
a good thing.</p>

<p>Finally, if you are talking about less than 100 interactive
users it is likely that any relatively modern hardware can support
it. If you are talking about having more than 1000 interactive
users, you should know how to predict your utilization, go
overboard on hardware, be willing to suffer growing pains, or be
able to hire someone that can help.</p>

<p>There are a number of good performance tuning articles out for
Solaris by Adrian Cockcroft. Go to your favorite search engine and
look for his name.</p>
