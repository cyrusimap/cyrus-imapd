<h1>Performance Notes
</h1>
<body>

Performance issues for you to consider. If you never expect to have
more than 100 simultaneous users, chances are any hardware you 
have will be fine. If you plan on having thousands or more users, 
please be sure to review this section.

<p>
If your configuration directory is not <tt>/var/imap</tt>, adjust
	accordingly. 

<p>
<ul>
<li><tt><b>/var/imap/proc</b></tt> - After a successful login, the imapd
creates a file in <tt>/var/imap/proc</tt> that is its unix process
id. It also contains the name of any <tt>SELECT</tt>'d mailbox. The
file is deleted when the user logs out.

<p>Given the potential load, this is a good candidate to move
elsewhere. This can be done by symlink'ing the directory to another
partition. We symlink it to a directory on a memory/viritual memory
filesystem (specifically Solaris' tmpfs). If you use a tmpfs type
filesystem, make sure that you have sufficient memory/swap to do this.

<p>Some people don't care about this information and just #ifdef out
the code. We probably should add a <tt>configure</tt> option to do
this.

<p><li><tt><b>/var/imap/deliverdb</b></tt> - Unless you disable
duplicate delivery suppression, each time a mail message is delivered
it needs to lock the database and check to see if the message-id has
been seen already. If you require really high throughput delivery, you
may want to disable this feature.  However, disabling this feature
also disables Sieve support.

<p>We run with it enabled and it doesn't significantly impact our
performance.

<p><li><tt><b>/var/spool/mqueue</b></tt> - Sendmail can be pretty
harsh on the spool partition. Having this on a separate disk is
usually a good idea.  Consider using LMTP and delivering from a
separate machine.

<p><li>Unused SASL mechanisms - If you just build the SASL library 
and copied all the mechanisms into /usr/lib/sasl, the <tt>imapd</tt>
will try to use them and allocate some amount of memory. In general,
the operating system will swap out those pages but you may be allocating
more swap space than you need. So, look in /usr/lib/sasl and if you don't
plan on using those mechanisms, don't leave them there. 

<p><li>You may want to increase the listen queue value when starting
up the master process.  For example, you may want to do this if you see
the Listen queue drop counter increasing quickly.  For example, under 
Solaris, look at the variable tcpListenDrop (from netstat -sP tcp).

</ul>
