<h1>Namelocks</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Name locks are an addition to the cyrus internals to address a
range of race conditions and complexities.  These ills are most easily
avoided by ensuring that only one process can do certain operations
at once.  Name locks also mean crashes can't leave the mailbox
"broken" forever.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, locks can't be retained over a rewrite-rename cycle,
and every meta file in a regular mailbox gets rewritten upon occasion.
Even cyrus.header gets a rewrite when a new userflag is added.</p>

<p>The "RESERVED FLAG" method of handling mailbox creation is a nasty
brutish method that breaks on process crashes, causing a full
mailboxes.db sweep to be necessary on restart, and making that name
unusable until the entire server is restarted.  It's also unusable
for serialisation of operations without making the mailbox "disappear"
to other clients.</p>

<p>Mailbox names are supposed to be exclusive per server, not just per
partition, so any lock has to apply to the entire server.</p>

<p><b>MURDER Considerations:</b>  Due to the way the mupdate protocol
works, RESERVED records are still created over mupdate.  This sucks,
and a better way would be to support an "EXCLUSIVE CREATE" command,
where the create only succeeds if the record doesn't already exist.
Then a task could create the mailbox on the local server and retain
an exclusive namelock while trying to assert the name on the mupdate
server.  If this failed (someone else got in first) then the mailbox
could be cleaned up locally before releasing the exclusive namelock,
meaning other users on the local server would never see it existing.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

It's a simple matter of having a file under $confdir/lock - in a
directory tree using the same hashing structure as the mailbox tree.
This directory can be symlinked or mounted to a tmpfs since the locks
need not persist across restarts.  Due to race conditions while
cleaning up, the easist approach is to only ever delete lock files
during restart, so the unlock code doesn't try to remove them.
Lock files are zero byte in size, and are locked using the flock
or fcntl primatives used by the rest of cyrus.

<h2>API</h2>

<p>Lock types:</p>

<ul>
<li>LOCK_SHARED - shared lock on the name.  Requried whenever you have
    an open mailbox with that name</li>
<li>LOCK_EXCLUSIVE - exclusive lock on the name.  Required to create or
    finish deleting a mailbox, and required when repacking the cyrus.index
    and cyrus.cache files.</li>
<li>LOCK_NONBLOCKING - attempt to take an exclusive lock on the name, but
    if it's not available, return immediately with r == IMAP_MAILBOX_LOCKED
    rather than blocking until the lock is available.</li>
</ul>

<p> The <tt>mboxname</tt> is always an <b>internal name</b>, so convert
it first.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<pre>
struct mboxlock *lock = NULL;
int locktype = LOCK_SHARED; /* or LOCK_EXCLUSIVE or LOCK_NONBLOCKING */

r = mboxname_lock("user.brong", &amp;lock, locktype);
if (!r) {
    do_stuff();
    mboxname_release(&amp;lock);
}
</pre>

<p>If mboxname_lock fails, lock will remain NULL.  It should always be
initialised to NULL before being passed to mailbox_lock.  It will be
set back to NULL by mboxname_release.</p>

<h3>Re-locking considerations</h3>

<p>It is not possible to hold multiple locks to the same name within the
same process.  If you call mboxname_lock with the same name within
a process, and the <b>same locktype</b> then a reference counter is
incremented and the same lock is returned.  If you use a <b>different
locktype</b> (i.e. one shared, the other exclusive.  Non-blocking is
considered exclusive for this test) then IMAP_MAILBOX_LOCKED will be
returned to avoid breaking the locking semantics.  This is a
restriction of the underlying fcntl/flock subsystem.</p>

<p>On the way out, the reference counter is decremented with each release
and the lock isn't freed until the counter gets back to zero.</p>
