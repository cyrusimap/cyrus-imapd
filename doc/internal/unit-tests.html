<a name="introduction"/><h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Recently, a set of regression unit tests has been added to Cyrus.  This
document explains the purpose implementation of those unit tests, and gives
an example of how to add more unit tests (because there are never enough
unit tests!).</p>

<a name="what-is-a-unit-test"/><h2>2. What Is A Unit Test?</h2>

<p>The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_test">definition on Wikipedia</a>
sheds some light:</p>

<blockquote>
...<b>unit testing</b> is a method by which individual units of source code are
tested to determine if they are fit for use. A unit is the smallest
testable part of an application.
</blockquote>

In other words, unit testing is about verifying that small pieces of code,
like individual functions, modules, or classes, work in isolation.  It is
<b>not</b> about testing the system as a whole.

<p>The tests implemented here are also <b>regression tests</b>, which in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing">Wikipedia&apos;s words</a>
means:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Regression testing</b> is any type of software testing that seeks to
uncover software errors after changes to the program (e.g. bugfixes
or new functionality) have been made, by retesting the program. The
intent of regression testing is to assure that a change, such as a
bugfix, did not introduce new bugs.
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the tests are designed to be easy to run and to
work out fully automatically whether they have passed or failed,
so that they can be run usefully by people who didn&apos;t write
them.</p>

<a name="running-the-tests"/><h2>3. Running The Tests</h2>

<p>This section takes you through the process of running Cyrus&apos;
unit tests.</p>

<a name="setting-up-the-machine"/><h3>3.1. Setting Up The Machine</h3>

<p>Cyrus&apos; unit tests are all located in a new directory,
<tt>cyrus-imapd/cunit/</tt>.  They're written in C, like the remainder of
Cyrus, and use the
<a href="http://cunit.sourceforge.net/">CUnit library from SourceForge</a>,
with some home grown wrappers and other improvements to make our
lives easier.</p>

<p>Your first step is step is to ensure that the CUnit library (including
the headers) is installed.  Some modern operating systems already have
CUnit, for example on Ubuntu you can just do:</p>

<blockquote class="cmds">me@ubuntu&gt; <b>sudo apt-get install libcunit1-dev</b>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternately, you can download the CUnit source, build it and install it.
It&apos;s not a complicated or difficult library, this shouldn&apos;t take
long.  When you&apos;ve done, install it in <tt>/usr/include</tt> and
<tt>/usr/lib</tt>.</p>

<a name="configure-scripts"/><h3>3.2 Configure Script</h3>

<p>Because of the dependency on the CUnit library, the tests are disabled by
default; this means you need enable them with an option to the
<tt>configure</tt> script:</p>

<blockquote class="cmds">me@mybox&gt; <b>./configure --enable-unit-tests</b>
...
checking for CU_initialize_registry in -lcunit... yes
checking CUnit/CUnit.h usability... yes
checking CUnit/CUnit.h presence... yes
checking for CUnit/CUnit.h... yes
...
</blockquote>

<a name="running-the-tests"/><h3>3.3 Make</h3>

<p>First you need to build Cyrus itself, using the traditional <tt>all:</tt>
target.</p>

<blockquote class="cmds">me@mybox&gt; <b>make all</b>
...
</blockquote>

<p>Then, use the new <tt>check:</tt> target to build and run the unit
tests.</p>

<blockquote class="cmds">me@mybox&gt; <b>make check</b>

</blockquote>

<p>Let&apos;s take a closer look at what's happening here.</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="note">(a)</span></dt>
<dd>The <tt>check:</tt> target causes automake to re-run itself.  This
is normal automake behaviour.  Note that the older build system used
to run make recursively in sub-directories, the newer automake-based
system builds everything from the top directory.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(b)</span></dt>
<dd>The <tt>cunit/</tt> directory contains a number of C source files
(called, for reasons too complicated to explain here,  <i>whatever</i>.testc)
with test code in them.  For each of those, a small wrapper C source
file is generated and then compiled into an object file.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(c)</span></dt>
<dd>Finally, all the compiled object files are linked into an executable,
with a <tt>main()</tt> routine from <tt>unit.c</tt>, and a number of
libraries and object files from other parts of the Cyrus tree.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(d)</span></dt>
<dd>The resulting executable is then run.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(e)</span></dt>
<dd>The test executable runs all the built tests one by one, telling
us which ones passed and which ones failed as it runs them.
You can also run it manually with the name of a test as an argument,
and it will run only the named test.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(f)</span></dt>
<dd>At the end, the text executable prints a summary of how many
tests it ran and how many passed and failed.  The key thing to look
at here is the rightmost column, it should be all zero.</dd>

</dl>

<a name="using-valgrind"/><h3>3.4 Using Valgrind</h3>

<p>Some failure modes are subtle, and cannot be detected in the C code
itself; this is where
<a href="http://valgrind.org/">the Valgrind program</a>
comes in very handy.  It detects buffer overruns and memory leaks and
various other kinds of subtle errors.</p>

<p>To run the unit tests with Valgrind, use the new
<tt>valgrind:</tt> target.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here's an explanation of what's happening in the example.</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="note">(a)</span></dt>
<dd>The test executable is run as before, but using the <tt>valgrind</tt>
program.  The first thing we see is Valgrind's banner message.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(b)</span></dt>
<dd>The test executable proceeds as normal and eventually emits it's
run summary, then exits.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(c)</span></dt>
<dd>After the test executable exits, Valgrind checks for memory leaks
and prints both a summary of all leaks and a stack trace showing where
each block of leaked memory was allocated.</dd>

</dl>

<p>I'd just like to say that I love Valgrind and I think it's immensely
useful.  I would have made running the tests under Valgrind the only
option for the <tt>check:</tt> target, except that Valgrind is not
available on all of Cyrus' supported platforms.</p>

<a name="the-tests-are-failing"/><h3>3.5 The Tests Are Failing</h3>

<p>So you've noticed that some of the tests are failing.  Let me make
the guiding principle of unit testing as clear as possible:
<b>THE UNIT TESTS SHOULD NOT FAIL</b>.  All of the tests are designed to
pass all the time, in everyone's environment.  The unit tests are
run automatically every twelve hours on the Cyrus
<a href="http://ci.cyrusimap.org/">Continuous Integration server</a>,
and a failing test fails the whole build and makes people unhappy.</p>

<p>There are a few rules which you should follow to help
us all get the most benefit out of unit testing</p>

<ul>
<li>If you see a test failing, investigate it.
<li>If you can't investigate, complain on the mailing list or raise a bug
    so that somebody else can investigate.
<li>When writing tests, write them to work in all environments and all
    combinations of <tt>configure</tt> script options.  It's ok to
    have a test which is empty in some circumstances; it's not ok
    to have a test that fails.
<li>When adding code, write new tests for the new code.
<li>When modifying code, write new tests for the new behaviour.
<li>When looking at old code, also take a look at the
    <a href="http://ci.cyrusimap.org/job/cyrus-imapd-master/887/cobertura/">coverage report</a>
    and consider writing tests for the existing code.
</ul>

<a name="debugging-a-test"/><h2>3.6 Debugging A Test</h2>

<p>With the new Cyrus build system, the file <tt>cunit/unit</tt> is no longer
an executable, it's a shell script which sets up some environment variables
before running the real executable which is hidden away.  This makes debugging
a failing test somewhat challenging.  The solution is:</p>

<blockquote class="cmds">me@mybox&gt; <b>( cd cunit ; libtool --mode=execute gdb --args unit -t crc32 )</b>
...
Reading symbols from /home/me/cyrus-imapd/cunit/.libs/lt-unit...done.

3       #include "crc32.h"
...
(gdb) <b>break test_map</b>

(gdb) <b>run</b>

11          c = crc32_map(TEXT, sizeof(TEXT)-1);

</blockquote>

<p>Note the <b>-t</b> option.  This turns off test timeouts, which is very useful
for manual debugging.</p>

<a name="adding-your-own-tests"/><h2>4. Adding Your Own Tests</h2>

<p>Adding your own tests is quite simple.  Here's how.</p>

<a name="where-to-put-your-tests"/><h2>4.1 Where To Put Your Tests</h2>

<p>The unit test code in Cyrus is contained in a set of C source files
in the <tt>cunit</tt> directory.  For reasons too complex to go into
here, these are named <i>whatever</i>.testc instead of the more usual
<i>whatever</i>.c.  If you look closely, you will see
that each of those C source files maps to a "Suite" in CUnit parlance.
For example, <tt>cunit/glob.testc</tt> is listed as the Suite "glob" in
CUnit's runtime output.</p>

<p>Typically, each Suite tests a single module or a related set of
functions; for example, <tt>cunit/glob.testc</tt> contains tests for
the glob module in <tt>lib/glob.c</tt>.</p>

<p>So, if you want to add a new test for a module which already has
some existing tests, the sensible thing to do is to
<a href="#adding-a-test-to-a-suite">add a new test to the existing suite</a>.
Otherwise, you'll need to
<a href="#adding-a-new-suite">add a new Suite</a>.</p>

<a name="adding-a-new-suite"/><h2>4.1 Adding A New Suite</h2>

<p>Each Suite is a single C source file in the <tt>cunit/</tt> directory.
Your first step is to create a new C source file.  For this example,
you'll create a new Suite to test the CRC32 routines which live
in <tt>lib/crc32.c</tt>.</p>

<blockquote class="cmds">me@mybox&gt; <b>vi cunit/crc32.testc</b>
...
</blockquote>

<p>The file should contain something like this.</p>

<blockquote class="src">/* Unit test for lib/crc32.c */
#include "cunit/cyrunit.h"  <span class="note">(a)</span>
#include "crc32.h"  <span class="note">(b)</span>

static void test_map(void)  <span class="note">(c)</span>
{
    static const char TEXT[] = "lorem ipsum";  <span class="note">(d)</span>
    static uint32_t CRC32 = 0x0;
    uint32_t c;  <span class="note">(e)</span>

    c = crc32_map(TEXT, sizeof(TEXT)-1);  <span class="note">(f)</span>
    CU_ASSERT_EQUAL(c, CRC32);  <span class="note">(g)</span>
}
</blockquote>

<p>Here's an explanation of what all these bits are for.</p>

<dl>

<dt><span class="note">(a)</span></dt>
<dd>You need to include the header <tt>"cunit/cyrunit.h"</tt>,
which is a thin Cyrus wrapper around the CUnit's library's
header, <tt>&lt;CUnit/CUnit.h&gt;</tt> with some extra
conveniences.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(b)</span></dt>
<dd>You should also include any headers you need for declarations
of the functions which you'll be testing.  Note that the Cyrus
<tt>lib/</tt> and <tt>imap/</tt> directories are already in the
include path, so any header in there can be included without
the directory prefix, e.g. <tt>"crc32.h"</tt> for <tt>lib/crc32.h</tt>.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(c)</span></dt>
<dd>You need to have at least one function which looks like this:
it takes no arguments, returns void, and is named <tt>test_whatever</tt>.
It may be <tt>static</tt> or <tt>extern</tt>, but I recommend <tt>static</tt>.
Functions with this signature are automatically discovered in the source
code by the Cyrus unit test infrastructure, so all you have to do is
write the function.  Later, a CUnit test named "whatever" will be
created automatically for your <tt>test_whatever</tt> function.
</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(d)</span></dt>
<dd>Here's a good place to define the test inputs and expected outputs.
Note that for this example you have no idea of the actual correct output.
The right thing to do there is to manually calculate the expected result
from first principles, or to use a different piece of software which
you believe to be working.  For this example, let's just use a known
incorrect value and see what happens.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(e)</span></dt>
<dd>Here's a good place for local variables you need during the test.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(f)</span></dt>
<dd>Call the function under test (<tt>crc32_map()</tt> in this example)
with known inputs, and capture the results in a local variable
<tt>c</tt>.</dd>

<dt><span class="note">(g)</span></dt>
<dd>Compare the actual result in <tt>c</tt> with the expected
result in <tt>CRC32</tt>.  The <tt>CU_ASSERT_EQUAL()</tt> macro
checks that it's two arguments are equal (using an integer
comparison), and if they're different it prints a message and
records a failure.  Note that unlike the libc <tt>assert()</tt>
macro, control will continue even if the assert fails.  The CUnit
library provides a whole family of similar macros, see
<a href="http://cunit.sourceforge.net/doc/writing_tests.html#assertions">the
online CUnit documentation</a> for more details.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Now you need to tell the Cyrus build system about your new Suite.</p>

<blockquote class="cmds">me@mybox&gt; <b>vi Makefile.am</b>
...
</blockquote>

<p>You need to add the filename of your new test to the definition
of the <tt>cunit_TESTS</tt> variable.</p>

<blockquote class="src">cunit_TESTS = \
        cunit/aaa-db.testc \
        cunit/annotate.testc \
        cunit/backend.testc \
        cunit/binhex.testc \
        cunit/bitvector.testc \
        cunit/buf.testc \
        cunit/byteorder.testc \
        cunit/charset.testc \
        cunit/<b>crc32</b>.testc \
        cunit/dlist.testc \
        cunit/duplicate.testc \
</blockquote>

<p>At this point you should be able to just rebuild and rerun using <b>make check</b>.
You can also just rebuild without rerunning by using the command <b>make cunit/unit</b>.
</p>

<p>
Note that sometimes this doesn't quite work right, and you may be able to work
around this problem using the command <b>rm cunit/default.cunit</b>.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Note how the test failure told us which in source file and
at what line number the failure occurred, and what the actual
and expected values were.  Let's go and fix that up now.</p>

<blockquote class="src">    static const char TEXT[] = "lorem ipsum";
    static uint32_t CRC32 = <b>0x72d7748e</b>;

<dd>Compare the actual result in <tt>c</tt> with the expected
result in <tt>CRC32</tt>.  The <tt>CU_ASSERT_EQUAL()</tt> macro
checks that it's two arguments are equal (using an integer
comparison), and if they're different it prints a message and
records a failure.  Note that unlike the libc <tt>assert()</tt>
macro, control will continue even if the assert fails.  The CUnit
library provides a whole family of similar macros, see
<a href="http://cunit.sourceforge.net/doc/writing_tests.html#assertions">the
online CUnit documentation</a> for more details.

<a name="suite-init-and-cleanup"/><h2>4.3 Suite Setup And Teardown</h2>

<p>Sometimes the behaviour of the functions under test depend on
external influences such as environment variables, global variables,
or the presence of certain files.</p>

<p>These kinds of functions need special treatment to ensure that their
behaviour is locked down during the running of your tests.  Otherwise,
all sorts of strange behaviour may confuse the results of the tests.
For example, a test might succeed the first time it's run in a given
directory and fail the next time.  Or a test might succeed when run
by the author of the test but fail when run by another user.</p>

<p>CUnit provides a special arrangement which helps you in such
cases: the suite initialisation and cleanup functions.  These are
two functions that you write and which live in the suite source.
They are called from CUnit respectively before any of the tests in
the suite is run, and after all tests from that suite are run.</p>

<p>Here's how to use them.  The suite setup function should
set up any global state that the functions under test rely on, in
such a way that their state is predictable and always the same no
matter who runs the test or when or how many times.  Similarly the
suite teardown function should clean up any state which might possibly
interfere with other test suites.  Note that some suites will need
an setup function but not necessarily a teardown function.</p>

<p>Adding these functions is very easy: you just write functions
of the appropriate signature (names, arguments and return type) and
the Cyrus unit test infrastructure will automatically discover them
and arrange for them to be called.  The functions should look like
(actual example taken from <tt>cunit/mboxname.testc</tt>) this:</p>

<blockquote class="cmds">static enum enum_value old_config_virtdomains;

<b>static int set_up(void)</b>
{
    old_config_virtdomains = config_virtdomains;
    config_virtdomains = IMAP_ENUM_VIRTDOMAINS_ON;
    return 0;
}

<b>static int tear_down(void)</b>
{
    config_virtdomains = old_config_virtdomains;
    return 0;
}
</blockquote>

<p>The functions should return 0 on success, and non-zero on error.  They
must not call and <tt>CU_*</tt> functions or macros.</p>

<p>Good luck and good testing!</p>
