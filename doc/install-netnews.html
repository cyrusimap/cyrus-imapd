<h1>Cyrus and Netnews
</h1>
<body>

<b><i>Note that the NNTP support in Cyrus is still relatively young in
the grand scheme of things, and has not been tested under a heavy
Usenet load.  That being said, the code appears to be stable and is
currently running in production serving 50-60 newsgroups with a volume
of about 6000 messages per day.</i></b>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Cyrus has the ability to export Usenet via IMAP and/or export shared
IMAP mailboxes via NNTP.  This is made possible by a new NNTP daemon
which is included with Cyrus.

<p>This document assumes that you have successfully been able to setup
your Cyrus IMAP server.  If you have not already done so, please refer
to the rest of the documentation.  This document also assumes that you
are familiar with Usenet and shared IMAP mailboxes.

<p>There is a <a href=netnews.png>diagram</a> that shows the interactions of
the various components of the NNTP support in Cyrus which may be
helpful in understanding the "big picture".<p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
You will need to build Cyrus IMAPd with the <tt>--enable-nntp</tt> configure
option.  This builds nntpd and the associated utilities.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
Obviously you must have a newsfeed or news reader access from your ISP
or Usenet provider.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
The first thing that must be done is to decide where your newsgroup
mailboxes will reside, either at the toplevel of your hierarchy (eg,
<tt>comp.mail.imap</tt>) or rooted elsewhere (eg,
<tt>netnews.comp.mail.imap</tt>).  If your newsgroup mailboxes are not
at the toplevel of your hierarchy, then you must specify the parent
with the <tt>newsprefix</tt> in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>.  Using the
example above, <tt>newsprefix</tt> would be set to <tt>netnews</tt>.

<p>You must create a mailbox for each newsgroup that you would like to
receive/export before the newsgroups can be used.  If some groups are
private, be sure to set the ACLs accordingly.  The
<tt>tools/mknewsgroups</tt> script can be used to help facilitate mass
creation of newsgroup mailboxes.  When using this script, be sure to
add posting rights for 'anyone' (eg. <tt>mknewsgroups -a 'anyone +p'
...</tt>) so that articles can be fed/posted.

<h3>Receiving articles</h3>
In order to receive usenet articles, you must make sure that the Cyrus
<tt>nntpd</tt> service is enabled in <tt>cyrus.conf</tt>.  The
<tt>master/conf/normal.conf</tt> and <tt>master/conf/prefork.conf</tt>
sample configs both include entries for <tt>nntpd</tt> (disabled by
default).

<p>Whenever <tt>nntpd</tt> receives an article, it automatically adds a
To: header with email addresses corresponding to the newsgroups
that the article is destined for (eg, post+comp.mail.imap).  The
presence of this header makes it easier for email clients to
post/reply to the newsgroup.  The "pseudo" user that is used when
constructing the email address can be specified with the
<tt>newspostuser</tt> option in <tt>imapd.conf</tt> (default = "post").

<h4>Push (traditional) feeds</h4>
If your usenet peer will be pushing articles to you, no further
configuration is necessary, beyond letting your peer access your Cyrus
server on port 119 (nntp).

<h4>Pull (suck) feeds</h4>
If you prefer to pull articles from your peer (and your provider
allows it), then you can use the <tt>fetchnews</tt> utility which will
retrieve articles from your peer and feed them to your Cyrus server.
If supported by your peer, <tt>fetchnews</tt> will use the NEWNEWS
command, otherwise it will fallback to keeping track of the high water
mark of each group.
You will probably want to configure <tt>fetchnews</tt> or
<tt>suck</tt> as an EVENT in <tt>cyrus.conf</tt> to be called
periodically (eg, once an hour, every 15 minutes, etc).

<p>As an alternative to <tt>fetchnews</tt>, you can also use the
 <a href=http://home.comcast.net/~bobyetman/><tt>suck</tt></a> program
 to pull articles from your peer.

<h4>imapfeed</h4>
Alternatively, if you already have an INN v2.3 server in-house you can
use the included <tt>imapfeed</tt> utility (written by the authors of
Cyrus) to feed articles to your Cyrus server via LMTP.  Consult the
INN documentation for further details.

<h4>Control Messages</h4>
Control messages are accepted, parsed and delivered to the
corresponding <tt>control.*</tt> pseudo-group (eg,
<tt>control.newgroup</tt>, <tt>control.cancel</tt>, etc) if it exists,
so that they may be reviewed by an administrator.

<p>Automatic execution of control messages is only performed if the
<tt>newsmaster</tt> (default = "news") user has the proper
access control for the given mailbox. For example, to allow cancel
control messages to be performed for "misc.test" articles, give the
"news" user the 'd' right on "misc.test".  To allow newgroup,
rmgroup and mvgroup control messages to be performed on the "misc"
hierarchy, give the "news" user the 'c' right on "misc".

<p><b>NOTE:</b> No sender or PGP verification of control messages is
currently implemented.

<h3>Reading/Posting articles</h3>
In order to have articles posted by your local users propagate to the
outside world, you must specify the name of your usenet peer with the
<tt>newspeer</tt> option in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>.  This is the host
that <tt>nntpd</tt> contacts to feed outgoing articles.  Also note
that you may specify an optional wildmat to filter which groups will
be fed (see <tt>imapd.conf(5)</tt> for details).

<h4>News clients</h4>

If anonymous logins are disabled (default) in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>,
then your news clients will have to be configured to login with a
username and password, otherwise they will not be allowed to post.
Furthermore, if plaintext logins are disabled in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>,
then you might have to configure your news clients to use SSL/TLS and
enable the <tt>nntps</tt> service in <tt>cyrus.conf</tt>.

<p>If you want to allow your news clients to use the NNTP NEWNEWS
command, you will have to enable the <tt>allownewnews</tt> option in
<tt>imapd.conf</tt>.

<p>To have articles posted by NNTP client fed to upstream servers, you
must set the <tt>newspeer</tt> option accordingly.  Depending on the
configuration of the <tt>newspeer</tt> option, articles will be fed to the
upstream server using either the POST or IHAVE command (see
<tt>imapd.conf(5)</tt> for details).

<p>Newsgroups can also be gatewayed to email by setting
<tt>/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/news2mail</tt> mailbox annotations to the
corresponding email addresses.

<h4>Email clients</h4>
If you are exporting Usenet via IMAP, and your users' messaging clients
are not savvy enough to reply to and post articles via NNTP, then you will
have to configure your server so your users can reply to and post
articles via SMTP.

<p>To help faciliate this, you can set the <tt>newspostuser</tt>
option to a userid which will be used to construct email delivery
addresses for each incoming article.  These addresses are inserted
into a <tt>To:</tt> in the article.  For example, if set to "post", an
article posted to <tt>comp.mail.imap</tt> will have an address of
"post+comp.mail.imap" inserted into the <tt>To:</tt> header.  This
will allow a user to easily reply to an article via email by using
their messaging client's "Reply All" feature.  Otherwise, the users
will have to learn the correct email address format for posting and
replying to articles.

<p>In order for these email messages to be fed into your news server
(and subsequently to the outside world) you need to use an email to
news gateway, such as <a
href=http://www.ossp.org/pkg/tool/lmtp2nntp/><tt>lmtp2nntp</tt></a>.  You need
to configure your MTA (Sendmail, Postfix, etc) so that
<tt>lmtp2nntp</tt> is used as the local mailer whenever it receives a
news article.  A simple rule for doing this in Sendmail is shown
below:

<pre>
# mail addressed to post+ goes to lmtp2nntp@localhost
LOCAL_RULE_0
Rpost + $+ &lt; @ $=w . &gt;		$#lmtp2nntp $@ localhost $: $1
</pre>

<p>For other configurations, consult the <tt>lmtp2nntp</tt> and
documentation and your MTA documentation.

<p><b>NOTE:</b> If anonymous logins are disabled (default) in
<tt>imapd.conf</tt>, then you should configure <tt>lmtp2nntp</tt> to
use its "feed" operation mode.

<h3>Expiring articles</h3>
Expiration of articles is done by the <tt>cyr_expire</tt> utility.
Control over when articles are expunged is accomplished with the
<tt>/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire</tt> mailbox annotation.  This
annotation sets the number of days that messages should be kept in the
mailbox before they expire.  All entries in the duplicate deliver
database that correspond to these messages are also kept for the same
number of days before they are purged (overriding the
<tt>cyr_expire -E</tt> option).

<p>Setting the expire time to 0 (zero) for a mailbox will ensure that
neither the messages nor the corresponding database entries will ever
be expired.  This can be useful for shared mailboxes (e.g. mailing
list archives) which are being exported via NNTP. <i>Note that this
will cause the duplicate delivery database to consistently grow in
proportion to the number of messages in such mailboxes.</i>

<p>If a mailbox does not have an expire time set on it, then the
messages will never be expunged, but the corresponding database
entries WILL be expired after the default number of days
(<tt>cyr_expire -E</tt> option).

<p>Note that the <tt>/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/expire</tt> mailbox
annotation is inherited by child mailboxes, so that you may control
expiration on an entire mailbox/newsgroup hierarchy simply by setting
the annotation on the root of the hierarchy.  For example, if you set
the annotation on <tt>comp</tt>, then ALL of the newsgroups in the
<tt>comp</tt> hierarchy will be expired at the same time.  Similarly,
if you set the annotation on <tt>alt.binaries</tt>, all of the binary
newsgroups under <tt>alt</tt> will be expired at the same time
(independently from <tt>comp</tt>).
