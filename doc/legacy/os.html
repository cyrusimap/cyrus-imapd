<h1>Operating System Notes</h1>

<h2>All</h2>

<ol>
<li> Shadow passwords
<br>On any system with shadow passwords (including Solaris 2.5 with
Unix authentication), read the SASL documentation carefully to make
sure it is configured correctly.
</ol>

<h2>Solaris</h2>

<ol>
<li>Modern Solaris systems have several useful utilities in
<tt>/usr/proc/bin</tt>, among them <tt>pmap</tt>.  This can be used to
calculate the incremental cost (number of non-shared pages) of an
<tt>imapd</tt> process, which is useful for sizing purposes.
</ol>

<h2>HP-UX</h2>

<ol>
<li> The memory mapping support (<tt>mmap(2)</tt>) in HP-UX does not
have the right semantics for the Cyrus IMAP server under the 9.0 and
10.0 release of the operating system. It appears this is related to
the hardware's use of inverse page tables. It is recommended that
large-scale sites consider using some other platform.

<p><LI> HP-UX 9.0.4: Comments from testers

<br> The C that ships with HP-UX is totally unsuited for use with unix
packages.  Either the HP-UX ANSI C developers kit must be purchased
separately from HP or GNU's gcc compiler (which can bootstrap itself
from the basic HP C) must be built on the target system.
</ol>


<h2>Linux</h2>

<ol>
<li> synchronous FS updates.
<br>By turning on synchronous updates for ext2fs, all updates (instead of
just meta-data) become synchronous. This is good for reliability, but bad
for performance.

<p> The big problem used to be with the <tt>mailboxes</tt> file. The
2.0 release and later addressed this problem by changing the flat file
to a Berkeley DB database.

<p>Note this is for ext2fs. If you are using a newer filesystem (such
as xfs, jfs, or reiserfs) the synchronous metadata issue shouldn't
come up.  Then again, we haven't really looked at other filesystems
for Linux yet.  (It appears that the different filesystems support
slightly different semantics, and it's not always clear what the right
thing for the application to do is.)
</ol>
