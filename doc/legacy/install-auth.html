<h1>Authenticating Users
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Cyrus IMAP Server uses the Cyrus SASL library to authenticate
users. Please refer to the Cyrus SASL documentation for specific
details on SASL. This section focuses specifically on the server processes
distributed with Cyrus IMAPd.

<h2>Authentication Mechanisms</h2>

At this writing, the underlying Cyrus SASL library supports a
variety of SASL mechanisms, including CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, KERBEROS_V4,
and GSSAPI.  The Cyrus IMAP, POP, and LMTP servers also support
STARTTLS using client-side certificates and the EXTERNAL
authentication method.

<p>GSSAPI is specific to Kerberos version 5. Additionally, STARTTLS client
side certificates have not been extensively tested.

<p>When STARTTLS is enabled, the PLAIN SASL mechanism (if installed)
also becomes available. This is because one should not pass a clear
text password over the wire unless the connection is encrypted.

<p>The IMAP protocol also supports a way for users to authenticate without
using SASL (the specification). This is via the 'LOGIN' command (not to be
confused by the LOGIN SASL mechanism). The IMAP LOGIN command (as with
PLAIN) will send your password in clear-text to the server.  In this case,
the password is still verified through the Cyrus SASL library, though no
SASL mechanism actually performs a negotiation.

<p>The POP server is capable of APOP authentication, but this requires that
Cyrus SASL be compiled <tt>--with-checkapop</tt>, and also that you are using
an auxprop backend for your password store (e.g. the sasldb auxprop plugin).

<h2>Authentication Recommendations</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you are running a mail server on a single machine, we recommend
that you configure the system to use CRAM-MD5 or DIGEST-MD5. We have not
provided utilities for you to let users change their passwords but either
we or someone else might provide that feature.

<li>If you have more than one mail server, we recommend that  you
configure the system to use GSSAPI and Kerberos5.

<li>If you have some other authentication mechanism that requires the
clear text password, you should use <tt>saslauthd</tt>.

<p><tt>saslauthd</tt> is something specific to the Cyrus SASL
libraries. While it is less generic than PAM, it is much simpler
to configure. The IMAP server simply sends a userid and a corresponding
password down a Unix domain pipe. Then, <tt>saslauthd</tt> takes that
userid and password and tries to authenticate with it -- using whatever
authentication you use -- and simply returns "yes" or "no" as to
whether or not the password was correct.

<p>It is possible to configure <tt>saslauthd</tt> to check these
passwords via a PAM mechanism, <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, or other
possibilities.

<p>PAM stands for pluggable authentication modules and the purpose is
to provide a common API which applications can use to obtain
authentication for a user. You can think of PAM as a complementary
layer under the SASL layer. See <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/FAQ">
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/FAQ</a> for more information
on PAM.  By using a PAM module, all the other applications on your
system can take advantage of it -- for example, login, xlock, etc.

<p>Keep in mind that when you use PLAIN or LOGIN you should encrypt
the stream so a user's password cannot be trivially sniffed off of
the network.
</ul>

<h2>Configuring Authentication</h2>

<p>Cyrus SASL has a number of options that can be configured by
the application.  To configure these via imapd.conf, simply prefix
the appropriate option name with <tt>sasl_</tt> (e.g.
<tt>pwcheck_method</tt> becomes <tt>sasl_pwcheck_method</tt>).

<h3>/etc/sasldb2</h3>

<p>The easiest method for authenticating users is to use the libsasl
authentication database and create users using the
"<tt>saslpasswd2</tt>" utility.  Set "<tt>sasl_pwcheck_method:
auxprop</tt>", and be sure that the SASL sasldb auxprop module is
installed (it is, by default). Make sure Cyrus can read "<tt>/etc/sasldb2</tt>":
<pre>
<kbd>   chown cyrus /etc/sasldb2*
</kbd></pre>

<h3>Shadow Passwords</h3>

<p>If you want to authenticate users from "<tt>/etc/shadow</tt>", things
are considerably more complicated, since the cyrus user cannot read the
shadow password file.  Additionally, this will not allow you to use shared
secret mechanisms.  To do this, it is necessary to configure libsasl with
<tt>saslauthd</tt> support, and set "<tt>sasl_pwcheck_method:
saslauthd</tt>".  The SASL library will then make calls to an external
utility running as root to authenticate users.

<h3>Kerberos</h3><a name="kerberos"></a>

<h4>Configuring Kerberos v4</h4>

<p>Cyrus IMAP supports Kerberos v4 if the SASL library was compiled
with KERBEROS_V4 support.</p>

<p>You'll have to
create a Kerberos v4 identity for the server and add the server's key to
the "<tt>srvtab</tt>" file.  The file must be readable by the cyrus
user. The server's Kerberos identity is "<tt>imap.HOST@REALM</tt>",
where "<tt>HOST</tt>" is the first component of the machine's host
name and "<tt>REALM</tt>" is the machine's Kerberos realm.</p>

<ol>
<li>Here is a sample session, creating a srvtab file for the
host named "<tt>foobar</tt>":

<pre>
<kbd>   ksrvutil -f /var/imap/srvtab add
</kbd></pre>

<p>Here is the information "<tt>ksrvutil</tt>" requests.  Respond by
filling in values or by pressing <KBD>RETURN</KBD>.  In this example,
the host name is "<tt>foobar</tt>" and the realm is
"<tt>ANDREW.CMU.EDU</tt>".</p>

<pre>
   Name: <kbd>imap</kbd>
   Instance: <KBD>foobar</KBD>
   Realm: <KBD>ANDREW.CMU.EDU</KBD>
   Version number:
   New principal: imap.foobar@ANDREW.CMU.EDU; version 0
   Is this correct? (y,n) [y]
   Password:
   Verifying, please re-enter Password:
   Key successfully added.
   Would you like to add another key? (y,n) [y] <KBD>n</KBD>
</pre></li>

<li><p>If you plan to install Kerberized POP, create the Kerberos
identity "<tt>pop.HOST@REALM</tt>" and add the key to the "<tt>srvtab</tt>"
file.  Likewise, if you plan on using LMTP over TCP, create the
Kerberos identity "<tt>lmtp.HOST@REALM</tt>" and add the key to the
"<tt>srvtab</tt>" file.</p></li>

<li><P>Make the "<TT>srvtab</TT>" file owned by the cyrus user:
<pre>
<kbd>   chown cyrus /var/imap/srvtab
</kbd></pre></li>

<li>Add the option srvtab option to <tt>/etc/imapd.conf</tt>:
<pre>   srvtab: /var/imap/srvtab</pre></li>

<li>Test using <tt>imtest -m KERBEROS_V4</tt>.  <tt>imtest</tt> will
attempt to authorize as the current Unix user regardless of the
current ticket's held.  Override this with the <tt>-u</tt> option.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Troubleshooting Kerberos_V4 problems</h4>

<p>Run the program "<tt>krbck</tt>" (found in the <tt>imap</tt>
directory) as the cyrus user on the IMAP server.  This program will
diagnose some common Kerberos v4 configuration errors.</p>

<h4>Configuring Kerberos v5</h4>

<p>Cyrus IMAP supports Kerberos v5 if the SASL library was compiled
with GSSAPI support.</p>

<p>You'll have to create a Kerberos v5 identity for the server.
Kerberos v5 keys are generally stored in "<tt>/etc/krb5.keytab</tt>".

<ol>
<li>Add the "<tt>imap/hostname</tt>" key using "<tt>kadmin</tt>".

<li> Let the cyrus user read "<tt>/etc/krb5.keytab</tt>":
user:
<pre>
<kbd>   chown cyrus /etc/krb5.keytab
</kbd></pre></li>

<li>Test using <tt>imtest -m GSSAPI</tt>.  <tt>imtest</tt> will
attempt to authorize as the current Unix user regardless of the
current ticket's held.  Override this with the <tt>-u</tt> option.</li>
</ol>
