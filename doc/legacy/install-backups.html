<h1>Installing Cyrus Backups</h1>

<p>Cyrus Backups are a replication-based backup service for Cyrus IMAP servers.
This is currently an experimental feature.  If you have the resources to try
it out alongside your existing backup solutions, feedback would be appreciated.</p>

<h3>Introduction and assumptions</h3>

<p>This document is intended to be a guide to the configuration and administration
of Cyrus Backups.<p>

<p>This document is a work in progress and at this point is incomplete.</p>

<p>This document assumes that you are familiar with compiling, installing,
configuring and maintaining Cyrus IMAP servers generally, and will only discuss
backup-related portions in detail.</p>

<p>This document assumes a passing familiarity with Cyrus Replication.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>Cyrus Backups are experimental and incomplete.</p>

<p>The following components exist and appear to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>backupd, and therefore inbound replication</li>
<li>autovivification of backup storage for new users, with automatic partition selection</li>
<li>rebuilding of backup indexes from backup data files</li>
<li>compaction of backup files to remove stale data and combine chunks for better compression</li>
<li>deep verification of backup file/index state</li>
<li>examination of backup data</li>
<li>locking tool, for safe non-cyrus operations on backup files</li>
</ul>

<p>The following components don't yet exist in a workable state -- these tasks must be
   massaged through manually (with care):<p>
<ul>
<li>recovery of data back into a Cyrus IMAP server</li>
<li>reconstruct of backups.db from backup files</li>
</ul>

<p>The following types of information are currently backed up</p>
<ul>
<li>mailbox state and annotations</li>
<li>messages</li>
<li>mailbox message records, flags, and annotations</li>
</ul>

<p>The following types of information are not currently backed up</p>
<ul>
<li>sieve scripts</li>
<li>subscriptions</li>
<li>quota information</li>
<li>seen data (?) other than the basic \Seen flag attached to a mailbox message record</li>
</ul>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>Cyrus Backups are designed to run on one or more standalone, dedicated backup
servers, with suitably-sized storage partitions.  These servers generally do not
run an IMAP daemon, nor do they have conventional mailbox storage.</p>

<p>Your Cyrus IMAP servers synchronise mailbox state to the Cyrus Backup server(s)
using the Cyrus replication (aka sync, aka csync) protocol.</p>

<p>Backup data is stored in two files per user: a data file, containing gzipped
chunks of replication commands; and an SQLite database, which indexes the current
state of the backed up data.  User backup files are stored in a hashed subdirectory
of their containing partition.</p>

<p>A twoskip database, backups.db, stores mappings of users to their backup
file locations</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>At least one Cyrus IMAP server, serving and storing user data.</li>
<li>At least one machine which will become the first backup server.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cyrus Backups server</h3>

<ol>
<li>Compile cyrus with the --enable-backup configure option and install it.</li>
<li>Set up an imapd.conf file for it with the following options (default values shown):
<dl>
    <dt>backup_db: twoskip</dt>
    <dt>backup_db_path: {configdirectory}/backups.db</dt>
    <dd>The backups db contains a mapping of user ids to their backup locations</dd>

    <dt>backup_staging_path: {temp_path}/backup</dt>
    <dd>Directory to use for staging message files during backup operations.  The
        replication protocol will transfer as many as 1024 messages in a single sync
        operation, so, conservatively, this directory needs to contain enough storage
        for 1024 * your maximum message size * number of running backupd's, plus some
        wiggle room.</dd>

    <dt>backup_retention_days: 7</dt>
    <dd>Number of days for which backup data (messages etc) should be kept within the
        backup storage after the corresponding item has been deleted/expunged from
        the Cyrus IMAP server.</dd>

    <dt>backuppartition-<em>name</em>: /path/to/this/partition</dt>
    <dd>You need at least one backuppartition-<em>name</em> to store backup data.
        These work similarly to regular/archive IMAP partitions, but note that there
        is no relationship between backup partition names and regular/archive partition
        names.  New users will be have their backup storage provisioned according to
        the usual partition selection rules.</dd>

    <dt>backup_compact_minsize: 0</dt>
    <dd>The ideal minimum data chunk size within backup files, in kB.  The compact tool
        will try to combine chunks that are smaller than this into neighbouring chunks.
        Larger values tend to yield better compression ratios, but if the data is
        corrupted on disk, the entire chunk will become unreadable.  Zero turns this
        behaviour off.</dd>

    <dt>backup_compact_maxsize: 0</dt>
    <dd>The ideal maximum data chunk size within backup files, in kB.  The compact tool
        will try to split chunks that are larger than this into multiple smaller
        chunks.  Zero turns this behaviour off.</dd>

    <dt>backup_compact_work_threshold: 1</dt>
    <dd>The number of chunks within a backup file that must obviously need compaction
        before the compact tool will attempt to compact the file.  Larger values are
        expected to reduce compaction I/O load at the expense of delayed recovery
        of storage space.</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Create a user for authenticating to the backup system, and add it to the
    <code>admins</code> setting in imapd.conf</li>
<li>Add appropriate <code>sasl_*</code> settings for your authentication method to
    imapd.conf</li>
<li>Set up a cyrus.conf file for it:
    <ul>
    <li>In the SERVICES section, arrange for backupd to run:<br />
        <code>backupd cmd="backupd" listen="csync" prefork=0</code></li>
    <li>You probably don't need any other SERVICES entries</li>
    <li>In the EVENTS section, arrange for compaction to occur at some interval(s)<br />
        <code>compact cmd="ctl_backups compact -A" at=0400</code></li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Start up the server, and use synctest to verify that you can authenticate to backupd</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cyrus IMAP servers</h3>

<p>Your Cyrus IMAP servers must be running version 3 or later of Cyrus,
and must have been compiled with the --enable-replication configure option.
It does <em>not</em> need to be recompiled with the --enable-backup option.</p>

<p>It's recommended to set up a dedicated replication channel for backups,
so that your backup replication can coexist independently of your other
replication configurations</p>

<p>Add settings to imapd.conf like:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>sync_log_channels: <em>channel</em></dt>
    <dd>Add a new channel "<em>channel</em>" to whatever was already here.  Suggest
        calling this "backup"</dd>

    <dt>sync_log: 1</dt>
    <dd>Enable sync log if you want rolling replication to the backup server
        (and if it wasn't already)</dd>

    <dt><em>channel</em>_sync_host: backup-server.example.com</dt>
    <dd>The host name of your Cyrus Backup server</dd>

    <dt><em>channel</em>_sync_port: csync</dt>
    <dd>The port on which your Cyrus Backup server's backupd process listens</dd>

    <dt><em>channel</em>_sync_authname: ...</dt>
    <dt><em>channel</em>_sync_password: ...</dt>
    <dd>Credentials for authenticating to the Cyrus Backup server</dd>

    <dt><em>channel</em>_sync_repeat_interval: 1</dt>
    <dd>Minimum time in seconds between rolling replication runs.  Smaller value
        means livelier backups but more network I/O.  Larger value reduces I/O.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Update cyrus.conf to arrange for replication to occur.  If you want to use
rolling replication, add a sync_client invocation to the SERVICES section specifying
(at least) the <code>-r</code> and <code>-n <em>channel</em></code> options.</p>

<p>If you want to use scheduled replication, add sync_client invocations to the EVENTS
section (or cron, etc), specifying at least the <code>-n <em>channel</em></code> option
(to use the channel-specific configuration), plus whatever other options you need for
selecting users to back up.  See the sync_client manpage for details.</p>

<h2>Administration</h2>

<h3>Storage requirements</h3>

<p>It's not really known yet how to predict the storage requirements for a backup
server.  Experimentation in dev environment suggests around 20-40% compressed backup
file size relative to the backed up data, depending on compact settings, but this is
with relatively tiny mailboxes and non-pathological data.</p>

<p>The backup staging spool conservatively needs to be large enough to hold an entire
sync's worth of message files at once.  Which is your maximum message size * 1024 messages
* the number of backupd processes you're running, plus some wiggle room probably.  In
practice it'll probably not hit this limit unless someone is trying to.  (Most users,
I suspect, don't have 1024 maximum-sized messages in their account, or don't receive
them all at once anyway.)</p>

<p>Certain invocations of ctl_backups and cyr_backup also require staging spool space,
due to the way replication protocol (and thus backup data) parsing handles messages.
So keep this in mind I suppose.</p>

<h3>Initial backups</h3>

<p>Once a Cyrus Backup system is configured and running, new users that are created on
the IMAP servers will be backed up seamlessly without administrator intervention.</p>

<p>The very first backup taken of a pre-existing mailbox will be big -- the entire mailbox
in one hit.  It's suggested that, when initially provisioning a Cyrus Backup server for
an existing Cyrus IMAP environment, that the sync_client commands be run carefully, for
a small group of mailboxes at a time, until all/most of your mailboxes have been backed up
at least once.  Also run <code>ctl_backups compact</code> on the backups, to break up big
chunks, if you wish.  Only then should you enable rolling/scheduled replication.</p>

<h3>Restoring from backups</h3>

<p>The restore tool will restore mailboxes and messages from a specified backup to a
specified destination server.  The destination server must be running a
replication-capable imapd or sync_server.  The restore tool should be run from the
backup server containing the specified backup.</p>

<h3>File locking</h3>

<p>All backupd/ctl_backups/cyr_backup operations first obtain a lock on the relevant
backup file.  ctl_backups and cyr_backup will try to do this without blocking (unless
told otherwise), whereas backupd will never block.<p>

<h3>Moving backup files to different backup partitions</h3>

<p>There's no tool for this (yet).  To do it manually, stop backupd, copy the files
to the new partition, then use <code>cyr_dbtool</code> to update the user's backups.db
entry to point to the new location.  Run <code>ctl_backups verify</code> on both
the new filename (<code>-f</code> mode) and the user's userid (<code>-u</code> mode)
to ensure everything is okay, then restart backupd.</p>

<h3>Provoking a backup for a particular user/user group/everyone/etc right now</h3>

<p>Just run <code>sync_client</code> by hand with appropriate options (as cyrus user, of
course).  See its man page for ways of specifying items to replicate.</p>

<h3>What about tape backups?</h3>

<p>As long as backupd, ctl_backups and cyr_backup are not currently running (and assuming
no-one's poking around in things otherwise), it's safe to take/restore a filesystem 
snapshot of backup partitions.  So to schedule, say, a nightly tape dump of your Cyrus
Backup server, make your cron job shut down Cyrus, make the copy, then restart Cyrus.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, your Cyrus IMAP servers are still online and available.  Regular backups
will resume once your backupd is running again.</p>

<p>If you can work at a finer granularity than file system, you don't need to shut down
backupd.  Just use <code>ctl_backups lock</code> to hold a lock on each backup while you
work with its files, and the rest of the backup system will work around that.</p>

<p>Restoring is more complicated, depending on what you actually need to do: when you
restart the backupd after restoring a filesystem snapshot, the next time your Cyrus IMAP
server replicates to it, the restored backups will be brought up to date.  Probably not
what you wanted -- so don't restart backupd until you've done whatever you were doing.</p>

<h3>Multiple IMAP servers, one backup server</h3>

<p>This is fine, as long as each user being backed up is only being backed up by one
server (or they are otherwise synchronised).  If IMAP servers have different ideas
about the state of a user's mailboxes, one of those will be in sync with the backup
server and the other will get a lot of replication failures.</p>

<h3>Multiple IMAP servers, multiple backup servers</h3>

<p>Make sure your sync_client configuration(s) on each IMAP server knows which users
are being backed up to which backup servers, and selects them appropriately.  See the
<code>sync_client</code> man page for options for specifying users, and run it as an
event (rather than rolling).</p>

<p>Or just distribute it at server granularity, such that backup server A serves
IMAP servers A, B and C, and backup server B serves IMAP servers D, E, F, etc.</p>

<h3>One IMAP server, multiple backup servers</h3>

<p>Configure one channel plus one rolling sync_client per backup server, and your
IMAP server can be more or less simultaneously backed up to multiple backup
destinations.</p>

<h3>Reducing load</h3>

<p>To reduce load on your client-facing IMAP servers, configure sync log chaining
on their replicas and let those take the load of replicating to the backup servers.</p>

<p>To reduce network traffic, do the same thing, specifically using replicas
that are already co-located with the backup server.</p>

<h3>Other setups</h3>

<p>The use of the replication protocol and sync_client allows a lot of interesting
configuration possibilities to shake out.  Have a rummage in the <code>sync_client</code>
man page for inspiration.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<h4>ctl_backups</h4>

<p>This tool is generally for mass operations that require few/fixed arguments
across multiple/all backups</p>

<p>Supported operations:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>compact</dt>
    <dd>Reduce backups' disk usage by:
        <ul>
            <li>combining small chunks for better gzip compression -- especially important
                for hot backups, which produce many tiny chunks</li>
            <li>removing deleted content that has passed its retention period</li>
        </ul>
        Note that the original backup/index files are preserved (with a timestamped filename),
        so that in the event of compact bugs/failures, data is not lost.  But this also means
        that compact actually <em>increases</em> disk usage in practice, until the old files
        are cleaned up.  This will probably be automated in some way once things are stable
        and reliable.</dd>

    <dt>list</dt>
    <dd>List known backups.  Add more <code>-v</code>'s for more detail.</dd>

    <dt>lock</dt>
    <dd>Lock a single backup, so you can safely work on it with non-cyrus tools.</dd>

    <dt>reindex</dt>
    <dd>Regenerate indexes for backups from their data files.  Useful if index becomes
        corrupted by some bug, or invalidated by working on data with non-cyrus tools.
        Note that the original index file is preserved (with a timestamped filename),
        so that in the event of reindex bugs/failures, data is not lost.  But this also
        means that reindex <em>increases</em> disk usage in practice, until the old files
        are cleaned up.  This will probably be automated in some way once things are stable
        and reliable.</dd>

    <dt>verify</dt>
    <dd>Deep verification of backups.  Verifies that:
        <ul>
            <li>Checksums for each chunk in index match data</li>
            <li>Mailbox states are in the chunk that the index says they're in</li>
            <li>Mailbox states match indexed states</li>
            <li>Messages are in the chunk the index says they're in</li>
            <li>Message data checksum matches indexed checksums</li>
        </ul></dd>
</dl>
<p>See the <code>ctl_backups</code> man page for more information.</p>

<h4>cyr_backup</h4>

<p>This tool is generally for operations on a single mailbox that require multiple
additional arguments</p>

<p>Supported operations</p>
<dl>
    <dt>list [ chunks | mailboxes | messages | all ]</dt>
    <dd>Line-per-item listing of information stored in a backup.</dd>

    <dt>show [ chunks | mailboxes | messages ] items...</dt>
    <dd>Paragraph-per-item listing of information for specified items.
        Chunk items are specified by id, mailboxes by mboxname or uniqueid, messages by guid.</dd>

    <dt>dump [ chunk | message ] item</dt>
    <dd>Full dump of one item.  chunk dumps the uncompressed content of a chunk (i.e.
        a bunch of sync protocol commands).  message dumps a raw rfc822 message
        (useful for manually restoring until a proper restore tool appears)</dd>
</dl>

<p>

<p>See the <code>cyr_backup</code> man page for more information.</p>

<h4>restore</h4>

<p>This tool is for restoring mail from backup files.</p>

<p>Required arguments are a destination server (in ip:port or host:port format), a backup file,
and mboxnames, uniqueids or guids specifying the mailboxes or messages to be restored.</p>

<p>If the target mailbox does not already exist on the destination server, options are available
to preserve the mailbox and message properties as they existed in the backup.  This is useful for
rebuilding a lost server from backups, such that client state remains consistent.</p>

<p>If the target mailbox already exists on the destination server, restored messages will be
assigned new, unused uids and will appear to the client as new messages.</p>

<p>See the <code>restore</code> man page for more information.</p>
