<h1>Cyrus HTTP (RSS, CalDAV, CardDAV, iSchedule, Timezone Service)</h1>

<b><i>Note that the HTTP service and associated modules in Cyrus are
    still under development.  This release should be considered beta
    quality.</i></b>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Cyrus <tt>http</tt> service has the ability to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Serve IMAP mailboxes as RSS feeds.</li>
<li>Act as a calendar and scheduling (CalDAV) server by using IMAP
  mailboxes as calendar collections and RFC 5322 messages to store
  iCalendar data.</li>
<li>Act as a contacts (CardDAV) server by using IMAP mailboxes as
  addressbook collections and RFC 5322 messages to store vCard
  data.</li>
<li>Allow scheduling transactions between separate calendaring and
  scheduling systems via the iSchedule protocol <i>(currently only used
  within a Cyrus Murder)</i>.</li>
<li>Act as a Timezone Service by serving iCalendar (VTIMEZONE)
  data to client systems.</li>
<li>Serve static content (such as the RSS feed list template and/or
  the CalDAV/CardDAV JavaScript clients mentioned below).</li>
</ul>

<i>Unlike the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP
    Server</a>, Cyrus HTTP is NOT a general purpose HTTP server.  Its
    feature set is limited to what is required to support the
    facilities listed above.</i>

<p>This document assumes that you are familiar with building and
  configuring a Cyrus server.  If you have not already done so, please
  read and understand the rest of the <a href="install.html">installation</a>
  documentation before continuing. Note: The
  "<a href="#install">Installation</a>" section below augments the
  "<a href="install-compile.html">Compiling the IMAP Server</a>"
  document.  The remaining sections assume that your Cyrus server has
  already been
  successfully <a href="install-configure.html">configured</a>.</p>

<p>This document also assumes that you are familiar with RSS, WebDAV,
  calendaring, and contacts.</p>


<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>

<p>You will need to build Cyrus with 
  the <tt>--enable-http</tt> configure option.  This builds httpd
  and the associated modules and utilities based on the availability
  of the prerequisites listed below.</p>

<h3>General Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Must have <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml2</a>
  installed.</li>
<li>Must have a recent <a href="http://www.cyrusimap.org/">SASL</a>
  release (v2.1.26 or later) in order to support HTTP Digest,
  Negotiate, and NTLM authentication.  Otherwise, only HTTP Basic
  authentication will be available.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional CalDAV / CardDAV Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Must
  have <a href="http://freeassociation.sourceforge.net/">libical</a>
  installed.</li>
<li>Must have <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> v3.x (or
  later) installed.</li>
<li>Optionally
  install <a href="http://www.digip.org/jansson/">Jansson</a> for
  jCal/jCard support.</li>
</ul>

<!--
<h3>Additional iSchedule Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Must meet CalDAV requirements above.</li>
<li>Must
  have <a href="http://www.opendkim.org/">OpenDKIM v2.x.x (or higher)</a>
  installed.</li>
</ul>
-->

<h3>Additional Timezone Service Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Must
  have <a href="http://freeassociation.sourceforge.net/">libical</a>
  installed.</li>
<li>Must have <a href="http://www.digip.org/jansson/">Jansson</a>
  installed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="config">General Configuration</h2>

<p>The Cyrus <tt>httpd</tt> service is configurable via several
  options in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>.  Several of those options are
  discussed in the sections below.  Admins should consult
  the <tt>imapd.conf(5)</tt> manpage for the full list of options used
  by the <tt>httpd</tt> service and its various modules.<p>

<p>The support for RSS, CalDAV, and CardDAV is divided into separate
  modules which run as part of the Cyrus <tt>httpd</tt>
  service.  Selection of which module(s) are enabled is
  done by setting the <tt>httpmodules</tt> option accordingly.  By
  default, no modules are enabled.</p>

<p>Cyrus <tt>httpd</tt> also can serve <i>static</i> content, the
  location of which is set by the <tt>httpdocroot</tt> option.  Any
  content contained in the specified directory (including
  sub-directories) will be served as static content only.
  Cyrus <tt>httpd</tt> does NOT have the ability to execute any
  server-side scripts.</p>

<h3>HTTP Authentication</h3>

<p>As with other Cyrus services, the Cyrus <tt>httpd</tt> service uses
  Cyrus SASL to perform its authentication.  Cyrus supports the
  following HTTP authentication schemes: Basic, Digest, Negotiate
  (Kerberos only), and NTLM.  While Basic is available in all versions
  of SASL, the remaining schemes are only available in Cyrus SASL
  2.1.16 (and higher).</p>

<p>Similar to plaintext login commands supported by the other Cyrus
  services (IMAP LOGIN, POP3 USER/PASS), the Cyrus <tt>httpd</tt>
  service determines whether to advertise the HTTP Basic
  authentication scheme based on the <tt>allowplaintext</tt> option
  and whether the client has connected over a TLS protected connection
  (HTTPS).</p>

<p>The availability of the other HTTP authentication schemes is
  controlled by the <tt>sasl_mech_list</tt> option.  For
  Cyrus <tt>httpd</tt> the <tt>DIGEST-MD5</tt>, <tt>GSS-SPNEGO</tt>,
  and <tt>NTLM</tt> SASL plugins support the Digest, Negotiate,
  and NTLM authentication schemes respectively, provided that these
  plugins are installed on the server.</p>

<h2>RSS Module</h2>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>When enabled, the RSS module will default to serving ALL mailboxes
  to which the authenticated user has access as RSS feeds.
  The <tt>rss_feeds</tt> option can be used to limit the set of
  mailboxes that can be served as RSS feeds.  For example,
  setting <tt>rss_feeds</tt> to <tt>*,!user</tt> will serve all shared
  mailboxes, but no personal mailboxes.</p>

<p>The list of available RSS feeds can be obtained by clients by
  accessing the <tt>/rss/</tt> URL on the Cyrus server.  By default,
  the server will present the list as a simple unordered list in an
  HTML document.  To customize the look and feel of the feed list,
  the <tt>rss_feedlist_template</tt> option can be used to point to a
  HTML template file.  This file can utilize Cascading Style Sheets,
  JavaScript, etc.  Any and all content that the template file
  references MUST reside under the <tt>httpdocroot</tt> as set above.
  Consult the <tt>imapd.conf(5)</tt> manpage for specifics on the
  required contents of   this custom file.  Note that for sites
  running Cyrus Murder,  <tt>rss_feedlist_template</tt> only needs to
  be set on frontend servers, since only those servers have the
  complete mailbox list.</p>

<h2>CalDAV Module</h2>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>When enabled, the CalDAV module allows Cyrus to function as a
  calendar and scheduling server.  This module uses a subset of the
  mailbox hierarchy as calendar collections, the toplevel of which is
  specified by the <tt>calendarprefix</tt> option.  The public
  calendar hierarchy will reside at the toplevel of the shared mailbox
  namespace.  A user's personal calendar hierarchy will be a child of
  their Inbox.  For example, using the default value
  for <tt>calendarprefix</tt>, a calendar named <tt>Default</tt> for
  user <tt>murch</tt> would reside in the mailbox
  named <tt>user.murch.#calendars.Default</tt>.<p>

<p><i>Note that mailboxes in the calendar hierarchies (those
  under <tt>calendarprefix</tt>) <b>SHOULD NOT</b> be accessed with an IMAP
  client as doing so will leave a mailbox in a state unsuitable
  for CalDAV.  To this end, calendar mailboxes will not be returned by
  Cyrus <tt>imapd</tt> in response to an IMAP client's request for the
  available mailbox list, but Cyrus <tt>imapd</tt> will not otherwise
  prevent an IMAP client from accessing them.</i></p>

<p>By default, the CalDAV module will automatically perform scheduling
  operations when a scheduling object (invite or reply) is stored
  on or deleted from the server.  Support for the calendar-auto-schedule
  feature can be disabled with the <tt>caldav_allowscheduling</tt>
  option.</p>


<h3>Administration</h3>

<h4>Calendar provisioning</h4>

<p>The CalDAV module will automatically create the required calendars
  for a user the first time that the user authenticates to the CalDAV
  server.  Note that the user MUST have an
  existing <a href="install-admin-mb.html">IMAP Inbox</a> in order for
  the calendars to be created.</p>

<h4 id="ACLs">Calendar access controls</h4>

<p>The CalDAV module uses the same access controls as the other Cyrus
  services.  The <tt>cyradm(1)</tt> tool can be used to adjust ACLs on
  calendars as needed.  The tables below show how the access controls
  are used by the CalDAV module.</p>

<h2>CardDAV Module</h2>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>When enabled, the CardDAV module allows Cyrus to function as a
  contacts server.  This module uses a subset of the
  mailbox hierarchy as addressbook collections, the toplevel of which is
  specified by the <tt>addressbookprefix</tt> option.  The public
  addressbook hierarchy will reside at the toplevel of the shared mailbox
  namespace.  A user's personal addressbook hierarchy will be a child of
  their Inbox.  For example, using the default value
  for <tt>addressbookprefix</tt>, an addressbook named <tt>Default</tt> for
  user <tt>murch</tt> would reside in the mailbox
  named <tt>user.murch.#addressbooks.Default</tt>.<p>

<p><i>Note that mailboxes in the addressbook hierarchies (those
  under <tt>addressbookprefix</tt>) <b>SHOULD NOT</b> be accessed with an IMAP
  client as doing so will leave a mailbox in a state unsuitable
  for CardDAV.  To this end, addressbook mailboxes will not returned by
  Cyrus <tt>imapd</tt> in response to an IMAP client's request for the
  available mailbox list, but Cyrus <tt>imapd</tt> will not otherwise
  prevent an IMAP client from accessing them.</i></p>

<h3>Administration</h3>

<h4>Addressbook provisioning</h4>

<p>The CardDAV module will automatically create a default addressbook
  for a user the first time that the user authenticates to the CardDAV
  server.  Note that the user MUST have an
  existing <a href="install-admin-mb.html">IMAP Inbox</a> in order for
  the addressbook to be created.</p>

<h4>Addressbook access controls</h4>

<p>Cyrus uses the same access controls for addressbooks as it does for
  <a href="#ACLs">calendars</a>, except that the scheduling rights (7,
  8, 9) have no use with addressbooks and are ignored.</p>

<h3>Client Setup</h3>

<h4>Apple Contacts</h4>

<li>Set the <tt>globalSettingsType</tt> option
  to <tt>addressbook-home-set</tt></li>
<li>Set any other options as desired.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h2>Timezone Service Module</h2>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>When enabled, the Timezone module allows Cyrus to function as a
  timezone service, providing timezone data to client systems.  This
  module stores timezone data in the <tt>zoneinfo/</tt> subdirectory of
  the Cyrus configuration directory (as specified by
  the <tt>configdir</tt> option).  The data is indexed by a database
  whose location is specified by the <tt>zoneinfo_db_path</tt> option,
  using the format specified by the <tt>zoneinfo_db</tt> option.</p>

<h3>Administration</h3>

<p>This module is designed to use the <i>Time Zone Database</i> data
  (a.k.a. <i>Olson Database</i>) converted to the iCalendar format.  The
  steps to populate the Cyrus <tt>zoneinfo/</tt> directory are as follows:

<ol start=0>
<li>Build the <tt>vzic</tt> utility located in
  the <tt>tools/vzic/</tt> subdirectory of the Cyrus source code.
  Simply running <tt>make</tt> in the <tt>tools/vzic/</tt>
  subdirectory should suffice.</li>
<li>Download the latest version of the Time Zone Database data
  from <a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones">IANA</a>.  <i>Only the
    data is required, NOT the code</i>.</li>
<li>Expand the downloaded timezone data into the temporary directory
  of your choice.</li>
<li>Populate <tt>configdir/zoneinfo/</tt> with iCalendar data:
  <p><i>Initial Install Only</i></p>
  <ol type=a>
    <li>Convert the raw data into iCalendar format by
      running <tt>vzic</tt>  as follows:
      <p><tt>vzic --pure --olson-dir &lt;location-of-raw-data&gt;
	  --output-dir &lt;configdir&gt;/zoneinfo</tt></p>
      <p>This will create and install iCalendar data directly into
	the <tt>configdir/zoneinfo/</tt> directory.</p>
      </li>
  </ol>
  <p><i>Updating Data Only</i></p>
  <ol type=a>
    <li>Convert the raw data into iCalendar format by
      running <tt>vzic</tt> as follows:
      <p><tt>vzic --pure --olson-dir &lt;location-of-raw-data&gt;</tt></p>
      <p>This will create a <tt>zoneinfo/</tt> subdirectory in your
	current location (preferably <tt>tools/vzic/</tt>).</p>
    </li>
    <li>Merge new/updated iCalendar data into
      the <tt>configdir/zoneinfo/</tt> directory by
      running <tt>vzic-merge.pl</tt> in your current location:
      <p><tt>vzic-merge.pl</tt></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>Rebuild the Cyrus zoneinfo index by
  running <tt>ctl_zoneinfo</tt> as follows:
  <p><tt>ctl_zoneinfo -r &lt;version-string&gt;</tt></p>
  <p>where <tt>&lt;version-string&gt;</tt> describes the recently
  downloaded timezone data (e.g. "Time Zone Database
  v.2013h").</p></li>
<li>Verify that the zoneinfo index database and all iCalendar data
  files/links are readable by the <tt>cyrus</tt> user.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h2>iSchedule Module</h2>

<p>This module will be automatically enabled if and only if both the
  CalDAV module and the <tt>caldav_allowscheduling</tt> options are
  enabled in a Cyrus Murder.</p>

<p><i>Support for scheduling with external servers is currently under
    development and will require a future release of OpenDKIM.</i></p>

<!--

<h2>DomainKey Module</h2>

<p><i>Currently unavailable.  Will be available once iSchedule support to
    external servers is available.</i></p>
