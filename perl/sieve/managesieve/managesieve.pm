=head1 NAME

Cyrus::SIEVE::managesieve - Perl client for the SIEVE protocol

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Cyrus::SIEVE::managesieve;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Perl module which provides a client for the SIEVE protocol.
It supports SASL authentication and communication encryption, using the
Cyrus SASL infrastructure.

It provides the following functions.

=over

=item sieve_get_handle($servername, &username_cb, &authname_cb, &password_cb, &realm_cb)

Creates and returns a new Sieve object which can be used for communicating
with the SIEVE server.  The server is connected to and a login sequence
is performed, using some combination of the given callbacks to fetch
from the calling program any data needed for authentication.

The I<servername> may take any of the forms

=over

=item I<hostname>

=item I<hostname>:I<port>

=item I<ipv4address>

=item I<ipv4address>:I<port>

=item [I<ipv6address>]

=item [I<ipv6address>]:I<port>

=back

If not explicitly specified in the I<servername>, the port defaults to
the port named "sieve" in the client machine's service database (for
example the C</etc/services> files), or 4190.

All the callbacks are called with the following arguments

$string = callback($which, $prompt);

where I<which> is one of the strings C<"username">, C<"authname">,
C<"getpass">, or C<"realm"> respectively, and I<prompt> is a
human-readable English language prompt string for the user's benefit.
Each callback should return a string containing the required
information.

The function will return I<undef> on error, use
I<sieve_get_global_error> to get a description of the error.


=item sieve_get_error($sieveobj)

Returns a human-readable English language string describing the last
error encountered on the object I<$sieveobj>.

=item sieve_get_global_error()

Returns a human-readable English language string describing the last
error encountered while creating a Sieve object.

=item sieve_logout($sieveobj)

Log out from the SIEVE server.  The I<$sieveobj> will become unusable.

=item sieve_put_file($sieveobj, $filename)

Installs a SIEVE script contained in a local file named by I<$filename>
to the server.  The name of the script on the server will be the
basename of I<$filename>.  Returns zero on success and non-zero on
failure.

=item sieve_put_file_withdest($sieveobj, $filename, $destname)

Like I<sieve_put_file> but also specifies the name of the file on the
server.  Any directory part of I<$destname> is ignored.

=item sieve_put($sieveobj obj, $name, $data)

Installs a SIEVE script contained in the scalar $data to the server,
with the script name I<$name>.  Returns zero on success and non-zero on
failure.

=item sieve_delete($sieveobj obj, $name)

Removes a SIEVE script from the server.  Returns zero on success and
non-zero on failure.

=item sieve_list($sieveobj obj, &callback)

Lists existing SIEVE scripts on the server.  The I<&callback> returns no
value and is called once for each script on the server, with arguments

callback($name, $is_active)

I<sieve_list> returns zero on success and non-zero on failure.

=item sieve_activate($sieveobj, $name)

Makes the script named I<$name> the active script on the server.  Only
one script is active at a time; activating a script de-activates any
others.  Returns zero on success and non-zero on failure.

=item sieve_get($sieveobj, $name, $output)

Retrieves the SIEVE script named <$name> from the server, and stores it
in the scalar I<$output>.  Returns zero on success and non-zero on
failure.
