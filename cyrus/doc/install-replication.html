<h1>Cyrus replication
</h1>
<body>

<b><i>Note that Cyrus replication is still relatively young in the
grand scheme of things, and if you choose to deploy you are doing so
at your own risk.  The core of the replication code has been used
successfully in production at <a
href="http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/~dpc22/cyrus/replication.html">Cambridge 
University</a> for about a year, but it has been rewritten extensively
as part of the integration into the mainstream Cyrus codebase.
</i></b><br>

<h3>Introduction &amp; Assumptions</h3>
<p>The Cyrus replication engine is designed to replicate the mailstore on
standalone Cyrus servers or "backend" servers in a Cyrus Murder to
provide a high-availability environment.  It is <b>NOT</b> intended to
replicate "frontend" servers or the "mupdate master" in a Cyrus
Murder.  <i>Note that load balancing is not possible with the current
replication code, but it is intended to be supported in the
future.</i></p>

<p>This document assumes that you have successfully been able to setup
atleast one Cyrus IMAP server.  This server will become your first
"master" server. It also assumes that you are familliar with the
administration and day to day operations of the Cyrus IMAP server and
the SASL authentication library. If you feel uncomfortable with this,
please refer to the rest of the documentation first.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
You will need to build Cyrus IMAPd with the
<tt>--enable-replication</tt> configure option.  This builds the 
replication client/server applications and utilities.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Atleast one standalone or "backend" Cyrus IMAP server.</li>
<li>Atleast one machine that will become the first "replica" server.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuring the "replica" server</h3>

The "replica" server is a standalone server which listens for
and processes synchronization messages from a "master" server.  The
"replica" server needs to be configured to accept these synchonization
messages.<p>

<ol>
<p><li>Configure a standalone server as described in the rest
of the documentation.

<p><li>Add the following line to the "<tt>/etc/services</tt>" file.

<pre>
   csync     2005/tcp
</pre>

<p>Note that the port number is arbitrary as long as its not being
used by any other services on your network.

<p><li>
Add a line similar to the following in the SERVICES section of cyrus.conf:<p>

<pre>
  syncserver       cmd="/usr/cyrus/bin/sync_server" listen="csync"
</pre>

<p><li>Start/restart <tt>"/usr/cyrus/bin/master"</tt>.

</ol>

<h3>Configuring the "master" server</h3>

The "master" server is the standalone or "backend" server which
is actively serving mailboxes to clients.  This server needs to be
configured to synchronize its mailstore with a "replica" server.<p>

<ol>
<p><li>Add the following line to the "<tt>/etc/services</tt>" file.

<pre>
   csync     2005/tcp
</pre>

<p>Note that the port number MUST be the same as that used on the
"replica" server.

<p><li>
Specify the hostname of the "replica" server and how to authenticate
to it using the following imap.conf options:

<ul>
<li><tt>sync_host</tt></li>
<li><tt>sync_authname</tt></li>
<li><tt>sync_realm</tt></li>
<li><tt>sync_password</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that <tt>sync_authname</tt> MUST be an admin on the "replica"
server.  Also note that <tt>sync_realm</tt> and <tt>sync_password</tt>
may not be necessary depending on the SASL mechanism used for
authentication.

</ol>

<h4>Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs)</h4>

An optional, but recommended step is to enable UUIDs for messages.
Use of UUIDs improves efficiency by eliminating the synchronization
of messages which the "replica" has already received from the
"master".  Note that UUIDs can be safely enabled and disabled at any
time.

<ol>
<p><li>
Define the <tt>sync_machineid</tt> option in imapd.conf.  This option
specifies the numeric identifier (1 - 255) of the "master" machine
which is used in constructing the UUID for each message on the server.
This identifier MUST be unique across all active "backend" servers in
a Murder.  Example:<p>

<pre>
sync_machineid: 1
</pre>

<p><li>For each IMAP, NNTP and LMTP service in cyrus.conf, enable the
<tt>provide_uuid</tt> argument.  Example:<p>

<pre>
imap	cmd="imapd" listen="imap" prefork=5 provide_uuid=1
</pre>
</ol>

<h4>"Rolling" replication</h4>

"Rolling" replication means that the "master" server continuously
synchonizes itself with the replica.  To configure "rolling"
replication, perform the following:

<ol>
<p><li>Enable the <tt>sync_log</tt> option in imapd.conf.  This allows
the <tt>imapd</tt>, <tt>pop3d</tt>, <tt>nntpd</tt>, and <tt>lmtpd</tt>
services to log synchonization actions which will be periodically
serviced by <tt>sync_client</tt>.

<p><li>Optionally, adjust the <tt>sync_repeat_interval</tt> in imapd.conf.

<p><li>
Add a line similar to the following in the STARTUP section of cyrus.conf:<p>

<pre>
  syncclient       cmd="/usr/cyrus/bin/sync_server -r"
</pre>

<p><li>Start/restart <tt>"/usr/cyrus/bin/master"</tt>.

</ol>

<h2>Administration</h2>

<h3>Manual replication</h3>

To manually synchonize any part of the mailstore, simply run
<tt>sync_client(8)</tt> with the appropriate command line options.
Note that you CAN manually synchonize even if "rolling" replication
has been configured.

<h3>Failover</h3>
