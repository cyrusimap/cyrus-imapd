<h1>mailbox format</h1>

<h2>intro</h2>

<p>
This is an attempt to document the cyrus mailbox format.  It should not
be considered authoritative and is subject to change.</p>

<p> No external tools should make use of this information.  The only
supported method of access to the mail store is through the standard
interfaces: IMAP, POP, NNTP, LMTP, etc.</p>

<p>
A cyrus mailbox is a directory in the filesystem.  It contains the
following files:</p>

<ul>
<li> Zero or more message files </li>
<li> the <tt>cyrus.header</tt> metadata file </li>
<li> the <tt>cyrus.index</tt> metadata file </li>
<li> the <tt>cyrus.cache</tt> metadata file </li>
<li> zero or one <tt>cyrus.expunge</tt> metadata file </li>
<li> zero or one <tt>cyrus.squat</tt> search indexes </li>
<li> zero or more subdirectories </li>
</ul>

<h2>message files</h2>

<p>
The message files are named by their UID, followed by a ".", so UID 423
would be named "<tt>423.</tt>". They are stored in wire-format: lines
are terminated by CRLF and binary data is not allowed.</p>

<h2><tt>cyrus.header</tt></h2>

<p>This file contains mailbox-wide information that does not change that
often. Its format:</p>

<pre>
&lt;Mailbox Header Magic String&gt;
&lt;Quota Root&gt;\t&lt;Mailbox Unique ID String&gt;\n
&lt;Space-separated list of user flags&gt;\n
&lt;Mailbox ACL&gt;\n
</pre>

<h2><tt>cyrus.index</tt>, <tt>cyrus.expunge</tt> and <tt>cyrus.cache</tt></h2>

<p>xxx not just caches; the index file stores stuff not present in the
message file! </p>

<p>
These files cache frequently accessed information on a per-message basis.
The index file holds fixed-length records on a per-message basis (and
a header for the mailbox of related metadata), while the cache
file holds variable-length information.</p>

<p> Any binary data in these files is stored in network byte order.
All of the binary data is also 4-byte aligned. Strings in the
<tt>cyrus.cache</tt> are stored NUL-terminated (this only applies to
<tt>cyrus.cache</tt>). To ensure alignment of following data, the end
of strings may be NUL-padded by up to 4 bytes.</p>

<p> The cyrus.expunge file has the exact same format as cyrus.index,
and holds the records of expunged messages which have yet to have their
corresponding cache records and messages files deleted.</p>

<p>
The overall format of these files looks sort of like this:</p>

<pre>
cyrus.index:
+----------------+
| Mailbox Header |
+----------------+
| Msg: Seq Num 1 |
+----------------+
| Msg: Seq Num 2 |
+----------------+
|     ...        |
+----------------+
</pre>

<p> The basic idea being that there is one header, and then all the
message records are evenly spaced throughout the file.  All of the
message records are at well-known offsets, making any part of the file
accessable at roughly equal speed.</p>

<pre>
cyrus.cache:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Gen # (32bits)|Size 1 (32bits)|Data 1                                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|           |Size 2 (32bits)|Data 2            |Size 3 (32bits)| Data 3  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .....                                                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre>

<p>
The cache file is different from the index file.  It starts with a 4
byte header (the generation number&mdash;more on that later), then it
has a whole bunch of entries in (size)(data) format.  The entries for
each message are always consecutive, and in the same order (i.e. for
any given message, the envelope is always the first bit of data), but
there is no way to tell (without use of an offset from the index file)
what message starts where.
</p>

<h3>detail of <tt>cyrus.index</tt> header</h3>

<p>The index header contains the following information, in order:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
Generation Number (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>A number that is basically the "revision number" of the mailbox.  It must
  match between the cache and index files.  This is to ensure that if we
  fail to sync both the cache and index files and a crash happens (so that
  only one is synced), we do not provide bad data to the user.</dd>

<dt>Format (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>Basically obsolete (indicates netnews or regular).</dd>

<dt>Minor Version (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>Indicates the version number of the index file.  This can be used
  for on-the-fly upgrades of the index and cache files.</dd>

<dt>Start Offset (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>  Size of index header.</dd>

<dt>Record Size (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>  Size of an index record.</dd>

<dt>Exists (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd> How many messages are in the mailbox.</dd>

<dt>Last Appenddate (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd> (time_t) of the last time a message was appended</dd>

<dt>Last UID (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd> Highest UID of all messages in the mailbox (UIDNEXT - 1).</dd>

<dt>Quota Mailbox Used (8 bytes)</dt>
<dd> Total amount of storage used by all of the messages in the mailbox.
Platforms that don't support 64-bit integers only use the last 4 bytes.</dd>

<dt>POP3 Last Login (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>  (time_t) of the last pop3 login to this INBOX, used to enforce
the "poptimeout" <tt>imapd.conf</tt> option.</dd>

<dt>UIDvalidity (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>The UID validitiy of this mailbox. Cyrus currently uses the
<tt>time()</tt> when this mailbox was created.</dd>

<dt>Deleted, Answered, and Flagged (4 bytes each)</dt>
<dd> Counts of how many messages have each flag.</dd>

<dt>Mailbox Options (4 bytes)</dt> 

<dd> Bitmask of mailbox options, consisting of any combination of the
following:
<dl>
<dt>POP3_NEW_UIDL</dt>

<dd> Flag signalling that we're using
"<em>uidvalidity</em>.<em>uid</em>" instead of just "<em>uid</em>" for
the output of the POP3 UIDL command.</dd>

<dt>IMAP_CONDSTORE</dt>

<dd> Flag signalling that we're supporting the IMAP CONDSTORE
extension on the mailbox.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt>Leaked Cache (4 bytes)</dt> 
<dd> Number of leaked records in the cache file.</dd>

<dt>HighestModSeq (8 bytes)</dt>

<dd> Highest Modification Sequence of all the messages in the
mailbox (CONDSTORE).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There are also spare fields in the index header, to allow for future
expansion without forcing an upgrade of the file.</p>

<h3>detail of <tt>cyrus.index</tt> records</h3>

<p>These records start immediately following the <tt>cyrus.index</tt>
header, and are all fixed size.  They are in-order by sequence number
of the message.</p>

<dl>
<dt>UID (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd> UID of the message</dd>

<dt>INTERNALDATE (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>INTERNALDATE of the message</dd>

<dt>SENTDATE (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>  Contents of the Date: header normalized to a Unix time_t.</dd>

<dt>SIZE (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>  Size of the whole message (in octets)</dd>

<dt>HEADER SIZE (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>  Size of the message header (in octets)</dd>

<dt>CONTENT_OFFSET (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>Offset into the message file where the message content begins.</dd>

<dt>CACHE_OFFSET (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>Offset into the cache file for the beginning of this message's
  cache entry.</dd>

<dt>LAST UPDATED (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>(time_t) of the last time this record was changed</dd>

<dt>SYSTEM FLAGS (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd> Bitmask showing which system flags are set/unset</dd>

<dt>USER FLAGS (MAX_USER_FLAGS / 32 bytes)</dt>
<dd> Bitmask showing which user flags are set/unset</dd>

<dt>CONTENT_LINES (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>  Number of text lines contained in the message content (body).</dd>

<dt>CACHE_VERSION (4 bytes)</dt>
<dd>Indicates the version number of the cache record for the message
(determines which headers are cached).</dd>

<dt>UUID (MESSAGE_UUID_SIZE bytes)</dt>
<dd>Universal UID of the message (used by replication code).</dd>

<dt>MODSEQ (8 bytes)</dt>
<dd>Modification Sequence of the message (CONDSTORE).</dd>
</dl>

<h3><tt>cyrus.cache</tt> file format detail</h3>

<p>
The order of fields per record in the cache file is as follows:
(keep in mind that they are all preceeded by a 4 byte network byte order
size).</p>

<dl>
<dt>Envelope Response</dt>
<dd>  Raw IMAP response for a request for the envelope.</dd>

<dt>Bodystructure Response</dt>
<dd> Raw IMAP response for a request for the bodystructure.</dd>

<dt>Body Response</dt>
<dd>  Raw IMAP response for an (old style) request for the body.</dd>

<dt>Binary Bodystructure</dt>
<dd><p>
 Offsets into the message file to pull out various body parts.  Because
  of the nature of MIME parts, this is somewhat recursive.</p>

<p>
  This looks like the following (starting the octet following the cache
  field size).  All of the fields are bit32s.</p>

<pre>
  [
   [Number of message parts+1 for the rfc822 header if present]
   [
    [Offset in the message file of the header of this part]
    [Size (octets) of the header of this part]
    [Offset in the message file of the content of this part]
    [Size (octets) of the content of this part]
    [Encoding Type of this part]
   ]
      (repeat for each part as well as once for the headers)
   [zero *or* number of sub-parts in the case of a multipart.
    if nonzero, this is a recursion into the top structure]
      (repeat for each part)
  ] 
</pre>

<p>
  Note if this is not a message/rfc822, than the values for the sizes
  of the part 0 are -1 (to indicate that it doesn't exist).  Sub-parts are
  not possible for a part 0, so they aren't included when finding recursive
  entries.
</p>

<p>
  The offset and size info for both the mime header and content part are
  useful in order to do fast indexing on the appropriate parts of the
  message file when a client does a FETCH request for BODY[HEADER],
  or BODY[2.MIME].
</p>

<p>
  Note that the top level RFC822 headers are a treated as a
  separate part from their body text ("0" or "HEADER").
</p>

<p>
  In the case of a multipart/alternative, the content size &amp; offset
  refers to the size of the entire mime part.
</p>

<p>
  A very simple message (with a single text/plain part) would therefore
  look like:
</p>

<pre>
  [[2][rfc822 header][text/plain body part info][0]]
</pre>

<p>
  A simple multipart/alternative message might look like:
</p>

<pre>
  [[3][rfc822 header][text/plain message part info]
      [second message part info][0][0]]
</pre>

<p>
  A message with an attachment that has two subparts:
</p>

<pre>
  [[3][rfc822 header info][rfc822 first body part info][attachment info][0][
	[3][NIL header info][sub part 1 info][sub part 2 info][0][0]]]
</pre>

<p>
  A message with an attached message/rfc822 message with the following
  total structure:
</p>

<pre>
    message/rfc822
      0 headers; content-type: multipart/mixed
      1 text/plain
      2 message/rfc822
        0 headers; content-type: multipart/alternative
        1 text/plain
        2 text/html
</pre>

<pre>
  [[3][rfc822 header part 0][text/plain part 1][overall attachment info][0][
       [3][rfc822 header part 2.0][text/plain part 2.1][text/html part 2.2]
          [0][0]]]
</pre>

</dd>

<dt>Cache Header</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  Any cached header fields.  These are in the same format they would
  appear in the message file:
</p>

<pre>
  HeaderName: headerdata\r\n
</pre>

<p>
  Examples include: References, In-Reply-To, etc.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>From</dt>
<dd>  The from header.</dd>

<dt>To</dt>
<dd> The to header.</dd>

<dt>Cc</dt>
<dd>  The CC header.</dd>

<dt>Bcc</dt>
<dd>  The BCC header.</dd>

<dt>Subject</dt>
<dd>  The Subject header.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>notes</h2>

<ul>
<li> Expunge is very slow (it requires rewriting both the cache and
    index file in addition to the unlinks; this is very painful on
    synchronous filesystems)</li>

<li> Append is relatively fast (it only adds to the end of both the
    cache and index files and modifies the index header)</li>

<li> Message delivery is something like this:

<ol>
<li> write/sync message file</li>
<li> write/sync new <tt>cyrus.index</tt> record</li>
<li> write/sync new <tt>cyrus.cache</tt> record</li>
<li> calculate, write, sync new <tt>cyrus.index</tt> header</li>
<li> acknowledge message delivery</li>
</ol>

<p>The message isn't delivered until the new index header is written. In
case of a crash before the new index header is written, any previous
writes will be overwritten on the next delivery (and will not be
noticed by the readers).</p>

<p>Note that certain power failure situations (power failure in the
middle of a disk sector write) could cause a mailbox to need
reconstruction (possibly even losing some flag state). These failure
modes are not possible in the "Hardware RAID disk model" (which we
will describe somewhere else when we get around to it).</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Future considerations</h2>

<ul>
<li> Cache all header fields? (or all up to Xk?)  This could greatly improve
    speeds of clients that just ask for everything, but also increases the
    expense of rewriting the cache file (as well as the size it takes
    on disk).</li>

<li> Reformat cache file to use a (size)(size)(size)(size)(data)(data)(data)
    format.  This makes accesses anywhere in the cache file equally fast,
    as opposed to having to iterate through all the entires for a given
    message to get to the last one.  Note that either way is still O(1)
    so maybe it doesn't matter much.</li>

<li> Can we do better with expunge if we don't rewrite the cache file as often?
    (instead, allow it to accumulate dead data, and only once in a while
     sweep through and clear out the dead data).  This should be fine
    from a correctness standpoint since if we eliminate the index record we
    just don't have a pointer to the cache file data anymore.</li>

<li> It would be useful to store a uniqueid -> mailbox name index, so that
    we could fix arbitron again.</li>

</ul>
