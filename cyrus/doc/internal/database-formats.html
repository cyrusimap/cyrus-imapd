<h1>Database Formats</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is an attempt to document the cyrus database formats.  It should not
be considered authoritative and is subject to change.</p>

<p> No external tools should make use of this information.  The only
supported method of access to the databases is via the API specific to
the database and the underlying cyrusdb interface.</p>

<h2>Mailbox List (mailboxes.db)</h2>

<p>
This database contains the master list of all mailboxes on the
system.  The database is indexed by mailbox name and each data record
contains the mailbox type, the partition on which the mailbox resides
and the ACL on the mailbox.  The format of each record is as follows:</p>

<pre>
Key: &lt;Mailbox Name&gt;

Data: &lt;Type Number&gt;SP&lt;Partition&gt;SP&lt;ACL (space-separated userid/rights pairs)&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Annotations (annotations.db)</h2>

<p>This database contains mailbox and server annotations.  The
database is indexed by mailbox name (empty for server annotations) +
annotation name + userid (empty for shared annotations) and each data
record contains the value size, value data, content-type of the data
and timestamp of the record.  The format is each record is as follows:</p>

<pre>
Key: &lt;Mailbox Name&gt;\0&lt;Annotation Name&gt;\0&lt;Userid&gt;\0

Data: &lt;Value Size (4 bytes)&gt;&lt;Value&gt;\0&lt;Content-Type&gt;\0&lt;Timestamp (4 bytes)&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Quotas (quotas.db)</h2>

<p>This database contains the master list of quotaroots on the
system.  The database is indexed by quota root and each data record
contains the current usage of all mailboxes under the quota root and
the limit of the quota root.  The format of each record is as
follows:</p>

<pre>
Key: &lt;Quota Root&gt;

Data: &lt;Usage (in bytes)&gt;SP&lt;Limit (in Kbytes)&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Legacy Quotas</h3>

<p>The legacy quota database uses a distributed system in which each
quota root is stored in a separate file named by quota root and the
contents has the following format:</p>

<pre>
&lt;Usage (in bytes)&gt;\n
&lt;Limit (in Kbytes)&gt;\n
</pre>

<p>The translation to/from this data record format is handled by the
quota_legacy cyrusdb backend.<p>

<h2>Duplicate Delivery (deliver.db)</h2>

<p>This database is used for duplicate delivery suppression, retrieving
usenet articles by message-id, and tracking Sieve redirects and
vacation responses. The database is indexed by message-id +
recipient (either mailbox or email address) and each data record
contains the timestamp of the record and the UID of the message within
the mailbox (if delivered locally). The format of each record is as
follows:</p>

<pre>
Key: &lt;Message-ID&gt\0&lt;Recipient&gt;\0

Data: &lt;Timestamp (4 bytes)&gt;&lt;Message UID (4 bytes)&gt;
</pre>

<h2>TLS cache (tls_sessions.db)</h2>

<p>This database caches SSL/TLS sessions so that subsequent
connections using the same session-id can bypass the SSL/TLS
handshaking, resulting is shorter connection times.  The database is
indexed by session-id and each data record contains the timestamp of
the record and the ASN1 representation of the session data.  The
format of each record is as follows:</p>

<pre>
Key: &lt;Session-ID (multi-byte)&gt;

Data: &lt;Timestamp (4 bytes)&gt;&lt;Session Data (multi-byte)&gt;
</pre>

<h2>PTS cache (ptscache.db)</h2>

<p>This database caches authentication state records, resulting in
shorter authentication/canonicalization times.  The database is
indexed by userid and each data record contains an authentication
state for the userid.  The format of each record is as follows:</p>

<pre>
Key: &lt;Userid&gt;

Data: &lt;Auth State (multi-byte)&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Seen State (&lt;userid&gt;.seen)</h2>

This database is a per-user database and maintains the list of
messages that the user has read in each mailbox.  The database is
indexed by mailbox unique-id and each data record contains the
database version number, the timestamp of when a message was last
read, the message unique-id of the last read message, the timestamp of
the last record change and a list of message unique-ids which have
been read.  The format of each record is as follows:</p>

<pre>
Key: &lt;Mailbox UID&gt;

Data: &lt;Version&gt;SP&lt;Last Read Time&gt;SP&lt;Last Read UID&gt;SP&lt;Last Change Time&gt;SP&lt;List of Read UIDs&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Subscriptions (&lt;userid&gt;.sub)</h2>

<p>This database is a per-user database and contains the list of
mailboxes to which the user has subscribed.  The database is indexed
by mailbox name and each data record contains no data.  The format of
each record is follows:</p>

<pre>
Key: &lt;Mailbox Name&gt;

Data: None
</pre>
