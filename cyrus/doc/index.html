<h1>Cyrus IMAP Server, version 2.0</h1>

<P> IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is an Internet standards-track
protocol for accessing messages (mail, bboards, news, etc).  The Cyrus
IMAP server differs from other IMAP server implementations in that it
is generally intended to be run on sealed servers, where normal
users are not permitted to log in.  The mailbox database is stored in
parts of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system.
All user access to mail is through the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP protocols.

<P>The private mailbox database design gives the server large advantages
in efficiency, scalability, and administratability.  Multiple
concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted.
The server supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage
quotas on mailbox hierarchies.

<P>The Cyrus project is the implementation of IMAP servers by 
the Carnegie Mellon University Computing Services Department.
Over the next few months, we will be releasing components of
this server, which will provide better mail security and
easier mail administration.
