                     Known bugs in the Cyrus IMAP Server

      * Multiple APPENDs don't always correctly return the EXISTS response. 
      * Particularly large quotas can wrap around. 
      * The Sieve subsystem will refuse to filter two messages with
        identical message-ids, even if they have different envelopes. 
      * The RENAME command does not have the hierarchical behavior required
        by the IMAP4rev1 specification. The CAPABILITY command now returns
        X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME in its response in order to advertise
        this bug. We plan to have this fixed eventually. 
      * Using AFS groups with ptclient, users with negative rights as part
        of groups may be granted access to mailboxes if ptclient has died.
        We plan to have this fixed eventually. 
      * 8-bit set characters are coerced to 'X', but not before the
        notify_zephyr code (if used) has had a chance to send them out. 
      * In some failures of the krbck program, the error messages printed
        out bear no resemblance to what actually went wrong. 
      * Deliver does not handle messages containing NUL properly due to
        stdio problems (the characters between the NUL and the LF will be
        lost.) 
      * Deliver doesn't gracefully handle CR CR sequences in messages.
        Well, ok, it hangs. 
      * cyradm doesn't handle BYE quite properly (especially a BYE right
        after connect). 
      * Random krb4 problems (and no, we don't know why they happen): 

          * It's possible to cause imtest/imapd to crash with Decoding
            error: Incorrect network address (krb_rd_req) by sending a
            large amount of information at once. Possibly fixed? 

                     Things we want to do

      * Implement the IMAP ID extension. 
      * Implement the IMAP VIEW extension. 

    Please report bugs to cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu. Be sure to include (at
    least) system type, compiler used, and the options passed to configure,
    along with a detailed report. Additional information is welcome, and
    naturally, patches are deeply appreciated. 

    If you submit a patch, please send unified diffs (-u) if your diff
    program supports them, or context diffs (-c) if it doesn't. Plain diffs
    are very difficult to evaluate.
