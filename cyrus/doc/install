           Installing and Configuring the Cyrus IMAP Server

    The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet
    standards-track protocol for accessing messages (mail, news, etc). The
    IMAP server stores and provides access to messages. 

    A list of answers to common installation problems is maintained in
    http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/imapd/install-FAQ.html. It is somewhat out
    of date and will eventually be updated. 

    Feedback on the software or on the document may be sent to
    "cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu". The info-cyrus@andrew.cmu.edu mailing list
    exists for the discussion of this server and other Cyrus software; more
    information is available in the mailing-list document. Be sure to
    include the version numbers of imapd and libsasl you are using, as well
    as your system type (and version!) and any configuration options you
    selected. 

    For detailed changes, refer to the file doc/changes in the
    distribution. 

Upgrading From Previous Versions

Upgrading from 1.6

      * Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.13 or earlier: if
        you use Sieve, you should run the "tools/upgradesieve" script, as
        the format of the "/usr/sieve" directory has changed slightly.
        timsieved, included in this release, will handle maintenance of
        Sieve scripts. 
      * Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.10 or earlier: if
        you export news via the IMAP server, you'll have to change your
        "newsfeeds" file to contain 

        collectnews!:*:Tf,WR:collectnews

        The format of the input to collectnews has changed. Duplicate
        delivery suppression is now required for Sieve. 
      * Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.1 or earlier: the
        quota and user directories are now hashed by the first character of
        the username. This is to reduce the number of entries in any given
        directory. It doesn't do a great job (and in some cases it will do
        a really poor job) but as a quick hack it shouldn't make things
        worse. Optionally, the data partitions can also be hashed by
        enabling the "hashimapspool" option. 

        You can automatically hash your directories using the "dohash"
        script in the tools subdirectory. If you want to hash your mail
        spool, be sure to set "hashimapspool" before running "dohash". This
        must be run as the Cyrus user. Be sure to stop mail service while
        converting. Doing this in single user mode is probably the safest. 

Upgrading from 1.5

      * Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.5 or earlier:
        libsasl is now required. Configuring SASL to work may be a chore,
        especially if you use shadow passwords. If you use shadow
        passwords, you must allow the cyrus user read access to
        /etc/shadow. 
      * An ANSI C compiler is now required. gcc should work fine and can be
        acquired from http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html. 
      * Upgrading from 1.5.14 or earlier requires deleting the delivered
        database. Remove the file delivered.db in the configdirectory and
        make a directory called "deliverdb" in the configdirectory. This
        may cause some duplicates to get through. 
      * Upgrading from 1.5.14 or earlier requires removing the PTS cache
        database (if the AFS PTS group support is used, which is not the
        default). The PTS cache is in /var/ptclient/ptscache.db, and you
        should remove it. This is because the format for the PTS cache for
        IMSP has changed. If you use AFS ACLs, IMSPd, and IMAPd on the same
        machine, make sure you have version 1.5a5 of the IMSP server for
        this version of the IMAP server. (If you don't have IMSP, or AFS,
        don't worry about it.) 
      * If you are upgrading from 1.5.14 (or earlier) you should remove the
        delivered-db database and mkdir /var/imap/deliverdb. 

Upgrading from before 1.3

      * Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.4 or earlier
        requires running "reconstruct -r" after installing this version of
        the software. 
      * Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.3 or earlier
        requires running "reconstruct -m" after installing this version of
        the software. 

Prerequisites and other notes

    The following programs and/or packages are required: 

      * makedepend. A version is included in the makedepend subdirectory of
        the distribution. Try and install it before installing the Cyrus
        IMAPd. If it fails, the configure script will use a dummy shell
        script instead of makedepend, and you should be sure to always give
        the command "make clean" before "make all". If you don't plan on
        doing any development, this isn't a big deal. 
      * Tcl, version 7.5 or 7.6, or 8.0. To obtain Tcl, see the
        comp.lang.tcl FAQ. Other versions of Tcl might work, but it must be
        at least Tcl 7.5. (Tcl 7.4 ships with some Unix variants, and it is
        not sufficient.). 
      * libsasl, version 1.5.0 or higher. To obtain libsasl, ftp it from
        ftp.andrew.cmu.edu. Earlier versions of SASL will not work; please
        get the latest one. Configure SASL so that it supports whatever
        authentication method your site uses. It is recommended that if you
        have PAM, you configure SASL to use PAM. 
      * perl is used for some administrative scripts. You don't need it but
        it may make your life easier. Version 5 is required. Perl is
        available from CPAN. 
      * You can use Berkeley DB instead of some DBM variant. Berkeley DB
        can be obtained from Sleepycat. DB is currently only used for
        duplicate delivery suppression and the AFS ptloader. 
      * If you use AFS PTS support for groups, Cyrus still depends on
        Kerberos and AFS. If you successfully compiled SASL with your
        Kerberos library, it's likely that it will work well with Cyrus. 
      * We use sendmail and we've gotten some others to work. If you want
        something with the least fuss, go with sendmail. Please use version
        8.7.1 or later as that includes support for Cyrus. Sendmail
        distributions may be obtained from http://www.sendmail.org. 
      * If you want to export netnews newsgroups using IMAP, the IMAP
        server must receive newsgroups with the INN news server. 

Compiling the IMAP Server

    Once you have unpacked the files by extracting the tar archive, "cd" to
    the "cyrus-imapd-NNNN" directory where NNNN is the version number. The
    configuration files and various subdirectories are stored there. In the
    directory that the configure file is in, type "./configure" to
    configure the software. 

    The "configure" shell script attempts to guess correct values for
    various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses
    those values to create a "Makefile" in each directory of the package.
    Finally, it creates a shell script "config.status" that you can run in
    the future to recreate the current configuration, a file "config.cache"
    that saves the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring, and a
    file "config.log" containing compiler output (useful mainly for
    debugging "configure"). 

    Running "configure" takes awhile. While running, it prints some
    messages telling which features it is checking for. 

    You can compile the package in a different directory from the one
    containing the source code. Doing so allows you to compile it on more
    than one kind of computer at the same time. To do this, you must use a
    version of "make" that supports the "VPATH" variable, such as GNU
    "make". "cd" to the directory where you want the object files and
    executables to go and run the "configure" script. "configure"
    automatically checks for the source code in the directory that
    "configure" is in and in "..". 

    By default, "make install" will install files (other than
    server-specific programs) in "/usr/local/bin", "/usr/local/man", etc.
    You can specify an installation prefix other than "/usr/local" by
    giving "configure" the option "--prefix=PATH". 

    You can specify separate installation prefixes for
    architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files. If you
    give "configure" the option "--exec-prefix=PATH", the package will use
    PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries. Documentation
    and other data files will still use the regular prefix. 

    By default, "make install" will install the server-specific programs in
    "/usr/cyrus/bin". You can specify a server-specific installation prefix
    other than "/usr/cyrus" by giving "configure" the option
    "--with-cyrus-prefix=PATH". 

    Here are a list of switches that can be used with "configure". 

    --cache-file=FILE 
            Save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
            "config.cache". Set FILE to "/dev/null" to disable caching, for
            debugging "configure". 

    --help  Print a summary of the options to "configure", and exit. 

    --quiet 
    --silent 
    -q      Do not print messages saying which checks are being made. 

    --srcdir=DIR 
            Look for the package's source code in directory DIR. Usually
            "configure" can determine that directory automatically. 

    --version 
            Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the "configure"
            script, and exit. 

    --with-cyrus-user=USER 
            Specifies the userid used for installing setuid programs. By
            default, configure uses "cyrus". 

    --with-cyrus-group=USER 
            Specifies the group used for installing setuid programs. By
            default, configure uses "mail". 

    --with-statedir=PATH 
            Specifies the directory used for the ptclient state
            directories. By default, configure uses "/var". 

    --with-auth=METHOD 
            Specifies the authorization module to use. Currently
            implemented authorization modules are: 

            unix    Unix /etc/passwd and /etc/group file 
            krb     Kerberos principals 
            krb_pts Kerberos principals with AFS PTserver groups 

            Since the login module is now SASL, this is much more
            confusing. We are considering adding group support to libsasl,
            thus solving this ambiguity. Make sure you select an
            authorization module compatible with your system. 

    --with-notify=METHOD 
    --without-notify 
            Specifies the new mail notification method to use. Currently
            implemented notification methods are: 

            zephyr  New mail notification through Zephyr 
            no      No new mail notification 

            By default, uses "zephyr" if the Zephyr libraries are
            available, otherwise "no".

    --with-inn=PATH 
            Specifies the location of INN's NEWSLIB directory. By default,
            looks for INN in a few common places. It is only necessary for
            "configure" to find INN if you are going to export newsgroups
            using IMAP. 

    --with-krb=PATH 
    --without-krb 
            Specifies the path to the Kerberos v4 libraries and header
            files (optional). By default, looks in "/usr/local" and then in
            the compiler's default link path. 

            IMPORTANT: The Kerberos v4 support requires the DES library.
            Some vendor distributions of Kerberos, including the one with
            Solaris, do not have this support and cannot be used. 

            Either "--without-krb" or "--with-krb=no" prevents Kerberos v4
            support from being compiled in. 

    --with-tcl=PATH 
    --without-tcl 
            Specifies the path to the Tcl (version 7.5 or 7.6) library and
            header file (optional). By default, looks in "/usr/local" and
            then in the compiler's default link path. The Tcl library is
            necessary to compile "cyradm", the administrative client. If
            compiling without Tcl, it is necessary to give configure the
            "--disable-cyradm" switch. 

    --with-zephyr=PATH 
    --without-zephyr 
            Specifies the path to the Zephyr library and header file
            (optional). By default, looks in "/usr/local" and then in the
            compiler's default link path. The Zephyr library is optional,
            if found it may be used to notify users of new mail.

    --with-lock=METHOD 
            Specifies the locking method to use. Currently implemented
            locking methods are: 

            flock   flock() locking 
            fcntl   fcntl() locking 

            By default, uses "flock" if the "flock()" function exists,
            "fcntl" otherwise. 

    --disable-sieve 
            By default, Sieve support is enabled. Note that you need
            duplicate delivery suppression enabled if you're going to use
            Sieve. Use --disable-sieve to disable compiling Sieve support

    --disable-cyradm 
            Do not compile the cyradm administrative client.

    --enable-amssync 
            Include AMS (Andrew Message System) to IMAP bboard
            synchronization support. Requires the AMS libraries. 

    --enable-cmulocal 
            Include Carnegie Mellon's internal support features. (Ignore
            this if you're not at CMU.) 

    "configure" ignores any other arguments that you give it. 

    Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
    the "configure" script does not know about. You can give "configure"
    initial values for variables by setting them in the environment. Using
    a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
    this: 

       CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

    Or on systems that have the "env" program, you can do it like this: 

       env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

    The "make" variables that you might want to override with environment
    variables when running "configure" are: 

    CC      C compiler program.
            Default is "cc", or "gcc" if "gcc" is in your PATH.
            (For "CC", any value given in the environment overrides the
            value that "configure" would choose.) 
    CFLAGS  Debugging and optimization options for the C compiler.
    CPPFLAGS 
            Header file search directory ("-IDIR") and any other
            miscellaneous options for the C preprocessor and compiler. If
            it is not set in the environment when "configure" runs, the
            default value is empty.
    LDFLAGS Stripping ("-s") and any other miscellaneous options for the
            linker. If it is not set in the environment when "configure"
            runs, the default value is empty. 
    DEFS    Configuration options, in the form "-Dfoo -Dbar ..."
    LIBS    Libraries to link with, in the form "-lfoo -lbar ..."
            (For "DEFS" and "LIBS", any value given in the environment is
            added to the value that "configure" chooses.) 

    If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, we encourage
    you to figure out how "configure" could check whether to do them, and
    mail diffs or instructions to "cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu" so we can
    include them in the next release. 

    The file "configure.in" is used as a template to create "configure" by
    a program called "autoconf". You will only need it if you want to
    regenerate "configure" using a newer version of "autoconf". 

    Once you have successfully run "configure", execute the following
    commands: 

       make depend
       make all CFLAGS=-O

    If you want, you can override the "make" variables CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
    by entering the following: 

       make all CFLAGS=-O2 LDFLAGS=-s

Configuring the IMAP Server

    This section describes the shell scripts to run and the configuration
    files to modify once "configure" and "make" have run. 

     1. Create a user and group for the Cyrus subsystem. The examples in
        this document assume a user of "cyrus" and a group of "mail",
        though any user and group name can be used. If a user other than
        "cyrus" is to be used, it must have been previously specified in
        the "--with-cyrus-user=" option to "configure". If a group other
        than "mail" is to be used, it must have been previously specified
        in the "--with-cyrus-group=" option to "configure". 

     2. After you've logged in as "root", install the cyrus software. 

           make install

     3. The Cyrus IMAP server uses the 4.3BSD syslog that separates
        messages into both levels and categories. Invoke "man syslog" to
        see if "openlog()" takes three arguments. If it does not, replace
        the system "syslogd" and "syslog.conf" with the files provided in
        the cyrus-imapd-1.5.14/syslog directory. 

           mv syslogd /etc/syslogd
           mv syslog.conf /etc/syslog.conf

        If you do not copy the "syslog.conf" file in
        "cyrus-imapd-1.5.14/syslog" to the "/etc" directory, be sure to add
        support for "local6.debug". The file should include a line like: 

           local6.debug  /var/adm/imapd.log

        You probably also want to log SASL messages with a line like: 

           auth.debug /var/adm/auth.log

        Create the log files: 

           touch /var/adm/imapd.log /var/adm/auth.log

     4. Create the file "/etc/imapd.conf". Here is a sample "imapd.conf"
        with a minimal number of values defined: 

           configdirectory: /var/imap
           partition-default: /var/spool/imap
           admins: curtj abell
           srvtab: /var/imap/srvtab

        For a description of all the fields in this file, see the
        imapd.conf(5) man page. (Note that this file also exports values to
        libsasl; the srvtab setting here is in place of the srvtab setting
        in the SASL configuration file.) 

        Note that everyday users should not be administrators. Admins have
        powers not granted to regular users and while the server allows
        them to receive mail, some problems will occur if admins are used
        as regular users. You also should not read mail as an
        administrator. You should have separate accounts for reading mail
        and administrating. 

     5. Create the configuration directory specified by the
        "configdirectory" option in "imapd.conf." The configuration
        directory is similar in concept to the "/usr/lib/news" directory.
        It stores information about the IMAP server as a whole. 

        This document uses the configuration directory "/var/imap" in its
        examples. This directory should be owned by the cyrus user and
        group and should not permit access to other users. 

           cd /var
           mkdir imap
           chown cyrus imap
           chgrp mail imap
           chmod 750 imap

     6. Create the default partition directories specified in the
        "/etc/imapd.conf" file. 

        This document uses a default partition directory of
        "/var/spool/imap" in the following example: 

           cd /var/spool
           mkdir imap
           chown cyrus imap
           chgrp mail imap
           chmod 750 imap

        The partition directory is similar in concept to /var/spool/news.
        It is where the mailboxes are stored. Unlike most netnews systems,
        Cyrus allows you to have more than one partition. Do not use the
        string "news" as a partition name, as it is reserved for netnews. 
     7. If you wish to use Sieve, and you didn't configure deliver to look
        in home directories (see the imapd.conf man page), create the Sieve
        directory: 

           cd /usr
           mkdir sieve
           chown cyrus sieve
           chown mail sieve
           chmod 750 sieve

     8. Change to the Cyrus user and use the tool "tools/mkimap" to create
        the rest of the directories (subdirectories of the directories you
        just created). 

           su cyrus
           tools/mkimap


        If perl is not available, it should be easy to create these
        directories by hand. 

     9. LINUX SYSTEMS ONLY: Set the configuration, user, quota, and
        partition directories to update synchronously. Failure to do this
        may lead to data corruption and/or loss of mail after a system
        crash. 

           cd /var/imap
           chattr +S . user quota user/* quota/*
           chattr +S /var/spool/imap

        Also set the queue directory of the mail daemon to update
        synchronously. The following example is for sendmail: 

           /sbin/chattr +S /var/spool/mqueue

    10. If the Cyrus IMAP server was compiled with Kerberos v4
        authentication, create a Kerberos v4 identity for the server and
        add the server's key to the "srvtab" file. The file must be
        readable by the cyrus user. The server's Kerberos identity is
        "imap.HOST@REALM", where "HOST" is the first component of the
        machine's host name and "REALM" is the machine's Kerberos realm. 

        Here is a sample session, creating a srvtab file for the host named
        "foobar": 

           ksrvutil -f /var/imap/srvtab add

        Here is the information "ksrvutil" requests. Respond by filling in
        values or by pressing RETURN. In this example, the host name is
        "foobar" and the realm is "ANDREW.CMU.EDU". 

           Name: imap
           Instance: foobar
           Realm: ANDREW.CMU.EDU
           Version number: 
           New principal: imap.foobar@ANDREW.CMU.EDU; version 0
           Is this correct? (y,n) [y] 
           Password: 
           Verifying, please re-enter Password: 
           Key successfully added.
           Would you like to add another key? (y,n) [y] n

        If you plan to install Kerberized POP, create the Kerberos identity
        "pop.HOST@REALM" and add the key to the "srvtab" file. 

        Make the "srvtab" file owned by the cyrus user: 

           chown cyrus /var/imap/srvtab

    11. Add the following lines to the "/etc/services" file if they aren't
        already there. 

           pop3      110/tcp
           imap      143/tcp
           imsp      406/tcp
           kpop      1109/tcp
           sieve     2000/tcp

    12. Add the following line to the "/etc/inetd.conf" file. 

           imap  stream  tcp  nowait  cyrus  /usr/cyrus/bin/imapd  imapd

        If you want to run the POP3 protocol, add the following line. 

           pop3  stream  tcp  nowait  cyrus  /usr/cyrus/bin/pop3d  pop3d

        If you want to run MIT's KPOP (Kerberized POP) protocol, add the
        following line 

           kpop  stream  tcp  nowait  cyrus  /usr/cyrus/bin/pop3d  pop3d -k

        If you wish to use to timsieved service, add the following line 

           sieve  stream  tcp  nowait  cyrus  /usr/cyrus/bin/timsieved timsieved

        "cyrus" is the Cyrus user and "/usr/cyrus/bin/" is the path name to
        the executable. 

        If you'd like to be able to do a ps and see what the imapd or pop3d
        is doing, you may need to add this to the end of imapd or pop3d
        inetd.conf entry. 

         junk to allow room for setproctitle xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    13. If you wish to use the interm finger information service, you need
        to enable support for it in "/etc/services" and "/etc/inetd.conf". 

        Note that this requires a finger client that supports this service.
        If you don't know that yours supports it, it doesn't. At this time,
        we are not providing a finger client that supports this. 

         1. Add the following line to the "/etc/services" file if it isn't
            already there. 

               fud       4201/udp

         2. Add the following line to the "/etc/inetd.conf" file. 

               fud  dgram  udp  wait  cyrus  /usr/cyrus/bin/fud   fud

    14. Restart inetd. Many systems provide an easy way to do this, but the
        generic method is to find the process id of inetd (use /bin/ps -elf
        on most systems), then kill -HUP pid. 

    15. Generate a sendmail configuration file which delivers local mail to
        the IMAP server. See the files cf/README and cf/cf/cyrusproto.mc in
        the Sendmail distribution for information on how to do this. Be
        sure the sendmail configuration file gets reloaded after you make
        the changes. 

    16. Edit /etc/group and add user "daemon" to the "mail" group. This
        will permit sendmail to run the "deliver" program to deliver mail
        to the IMAP server. 

    17. The Cyrus IMAP server support in Sendmail defaults to enabling
        duplicate delivery suppression, by invoking the "deliver" program
        with the "-e" switch. This prevents two messages with the same
        Message-ID: (Resent-Message-ID: if it exits) from being delivered
        to the same mailbox. Add a cron job to periodically prune the
        database of deliveries by running "/usr/cyrus/bin/deliver -E 3"
        daily as the cyrus user. 

        Duplicate delivery suppression is required if you are using Sieve. 

        If you want to export netnews newsgroups using IMAP do the
        following: 

         1. Create a directory for the "news" partition. This directory
            should be different than the news spool directory. This
            document uses a news partition directory of
            "/var/spool/imap-news" in the following examples: 

               cd /var/spool
               mkdir imap-news
               chown cyrus imap-news
               chgrp mail imap-news
               chmod 750 imap-news

         2. Set the "partition-news" and "newsspool" options to appropriate
            values: 

               partition-news: /var/spool/imap-news
               newsspool: /var/spool/news

         3. The cyrus user must be able to write to the out.going
            ("/var/spool/news/out.going") directory. This can be done by
            putting the cyrus user into the news group and making the
            oug.going directory group writable. 

         4. Add the following line to the newsfeeds file 

               collectnews!:*:Tf,WO:collectnews

         5. Add a cron job to run "/usr/cyrus/bin/feedcyrus" every ten
            minutes as the cyrus user. Also add a cron job to run
            "/usr/cyrus/bin/syncnews /var/news/active >/dev/null 2>&1"
            nightly. (Using the appropriate path to the active file.) 

Testing the IMAP Server

    To test the IMAP server, reboot and perform the following steps (all of
    these samples use "foobar" as the IMAP server name). A list of answers
    to common installation problems is maintained in
    http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/imapd/install-FAQ. 

     1. If the server is compiled with Kerberos v4 authentication, run the
        program "krbck" as the cyrus user on the IMAP server. This program
        will diagnose some common Kerberos configuration errors. 

     2. From your normal account, telnet to the IMAP port on the server
        you're setting up: 

           telnet foobar imap

        If your server is running, you'll get the following message: 

           Trying 128.2.232.95...
           Connected to foobar.andrew.cmu.edu.
           Escape character is '^]'.
           * OK foobar.andrew.cmu.edu Cyrus IMAP4 v1.6.0 server ready

        Any message other than one starting with "* OK" means there is a
        problem. To terminate the connection, type ". logout". 

        Naturally the version number should match the version you just
        installed. 

     3. Use "imtest" to test logging in with plaintext passwords. 

           /usr/local/bin/imtest -m login -p imap foobar

        If your server is running, you'll get the following message: 

           * OK foobar.andrew.cmu.edu Cyrus IMAP4 v1.6.0 server ready
           Password: <enter your password, imtest does not echo it>
           . LOGIN smith X
           . OK User logged in

        Any message other than one starting with a ". OK" means there is a
        problem. If the test fails, a more specific error message is
        written through syslog to the server log. To terminate the
        connection, type ". logout". 

     4. You should now test the server with each of the various
        authentication mechanisms you have installed. First to find the
        mechanisms the server thinks are installed use imtest as above.
        After imtest logs in type: 

         
           . CAPABILITY

        This should produce a message similar to: 

          * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 ACL QUOTA LITERAL+ NAMESPACE UIDPLUS 
          X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME NO_ATOMIC_RENAME AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=ANONYMOUS
          AUTH=KERBEROS_V4 AUTH=DIGEST-MD5 AUTH=CRAM-MD5 UNSELECT
          . OK Completed

        Each of the mechanism names is preceded by a 'AUTH='. For this
        example PLAIN, ANONYMOUS, KERBEROS_V4, DIGEST-MD5, and CRAM-MD5 are
        available. If a mechanism does not appear that you believe should
        appear it may be because the mechanism is unable to initialize. For
        example, if the server is unable to access the srvtab file the
        KERBEROS_V4 mechanism will be unable to initialize. To terminate
        the imtest connection, type ". logout". Once you are satisfied with
        the authentication mechanism list you should attempt to log in with
        each of those mechanisms. Change to the "cyrus-v1.5.14" directory
        and run imtest specify\ing which mechanism you would like to use.
        The mechanism name must be in all capital letters. For example for
        KERBEROS_V4 type: 

           /usr/local/bin/imtest -m KERBEROS_V4 -p imap foobar
           * OK foobar.andrew.cmu.edu Cyrus IMAP4 v1.5.14 server ready
           . AUTHENTICATE KERBEROS_V4
           + Ln8h6Q==
           BAcBQU5EUkVXLkNNVS5FRFUAOCA+0y5YnrqIVikng46sam7RSObZXCVSA9xCx
           BZSGgOy9ehHRj8NQjLjxDpib0D9uT0fo7QaXhLM6zCp9dQ1pX4FfNO2V39vBp
           Q19QIK4S1410prvM2c45qeizecI7zAvA=
           2cRhIC+aH70WHqYaW18YnQ==
           . OK User logged in (no protection)
           __No integrity protection__

        Any message other than one starting with a "A01 OK" means there is
        a problem. If the test fails, a more specific error message is
        written through syslog to the server log. To terminate the
        connection, type ". logout". Make sure to test each mechanism this
        way. Also, many mechanisms have security layers. You should test
        each layer for mechanisms that support layers. imtest by default
        will choose the strongest layer. Use the '-l' parameter to force
        imtest to use a weaker layer. The '-l' parameter takes the security
        strength factor. A security strength factor of 0 means no layer and
        1 means integrity layer. Privacy layer security strength factors
        depend upon the mechanism. For example KERBEROS_V4 has 3 layers:
        none, integrity, and privacy with security strength factors of 0,1,
        and 56 respectivly. By default imtest will attempt to use privacy
        layer. To force imtest to negotiate an integrity layer type: 

          imtest -m KERBEROS_V4 -l 1 -p imap foobar

        See the libsasl documentation for a full description of what
        mechanisms support what layers. 

Testing the sieve server

     1. The Sieve server, "timsieved", is used for transporting user Sieve
        scripts to the sealed IMAP server. It is incompatible with the
        "sieveusehomedir" option. It is named after the principal author,
        Tim Martin, who desperately wanted something named after him in the
        Cyrus distribution. 

     2. From your normal account, telnet to the sieve port on the server
        you're setting up: 

           telnet foobar sieve

        If your server is running, you'll get a message similar to the
        following one: 

           Trying 128.2.10.192...
           Connected to cyrus-dev.andrew.cmu.edu.
           Escape character is '^]'.
           "CMU Experimental Sieved version 0.99" "SASL={GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS, PLAIN, KERBEROS_V4}"

        Any message other than one similar to the one above means there is
        a problem. Make sure all of authentication methods you wish to
        support are listed. This list should be identical to the one listed
        by "imapd" earlier. Next terminate the connection, by typing
        "logout". 

     3. Next test authenticating to the sieve server. To do this run the
        "installsieve" utility. You must specify the server. You may have
        to specify the port if you run this utility from a different
        machine without the "sieve" entry in "/etc/services". To specify
        the port use the "-p [port]" switch. 

          "installsieve foobar"

        This should produce the message "Authentication failed" with a
        description of the failure if there was a problem. 

        You might wish to test all authentication types. To force
        installsieve to use a specific mechanism use the "-m [mechanism]"
        switch. 

     4. Next you should attempt to place a sieve script on the server. To
        do this create a file named "myscript.script" with the following
        lines. Replace "foo@bar.org" with an email address you can send
        mail from, but that is not the one you are working on now. 

          require ["reject","fileinto"];

          if address :is :all "From" "foo@bar.org"
          {
            reject "testing";
          }

        To place this script on the server run the following command
        "installsieve -i myscript.script foobar" This should place your
        script on the server and make it the active script. 

     5. Test that the sieve script is actually run from deliver. Send a
        message to the address you're working on from the address mentioned
        in the sieve script. The message should be rejected. 

Administering Mailboxes

    The "cyradm" command (see the cyradm(8) man page for complete
    documentation) manages the creation of, deletion of, ACLs on, and
    quotas on mailboxes. To get an overview of the command, type "cyradm
    <host>". Once "cyradm" has started, the user prompt is replaced with
    the name of the host followed by a ">". Type "help" at the new prompt.
    The following information is displayed: 

       createmailbox, cm        create a mailbox
       deleteaclmailbox, dam    delete an ACL on a mailbox
       deletemailbox, dm        delete a mailbox
       help                     get help on commands
       listaclmailbox, lam      list the ACL on a mailbox
       listmailbox, lm          list mailboxes
       listquota, lq            list quota on root
       listquotaroot, lqr, lqm  list quota roots on mailbox
       quit                     exit program
       renamemailbox, renm      rename a mailbox
       setaclmailbox, sam       set an ACL on a mailbox
       setquota, sq             set quota limits

    Note:If you run "cyradm" on a system where Kerberos v4 is not running,
    you are prompted for your user name an password before you can issue
    any "cyradm" commands. 

    The mailbox naming convention requires that the primary mailbox (inbox)
    for anyone must be named "user.<userid>". To create a mailbox, type: 

       createmailbox user.<userid>

    For example, to create a mailbox for the userid "smith", type: 

       createmailbox user.smith

    To limit "smith" to 10,000 kilobytes of mail, type: 

       setquota user.smith 10000

    Once the inbox is created, users can create their own additional
    mailboxes from a mail program. If Smith created a work mailbox and a
    play mailbox, the full names of the mailboxes would be: 

       user.smith.work
       user.smith.play

    Access rights are discussed in detail in the cyradm(1) man pages. Note
    that the administrator must grant herself delete access explicitly
    before she can delete a mailbox: 

       setaclmailbox <mail_box> <admin_userid> d
       deletemailbox <mail_box>

    Once you have created mailboxes, your IMAP server installation is done.
    You must then configure a mail interface, such as Pine, to work with
    the IMAP server. 

Performance Notes

    If your configuration directory is not /var/imap, adjust accordingly. 

      * /var/imap/proc - After a successful login, the imapd creates a file
        in /var/imap/proc that is its unix process id. It also contains the
        name of any SELECT'd mailbox. The file is deleted when the user
        logs out. 

        Given the potential load, this is a good candidate to move
        elsewhere. This can be done by symlink'ing the directory to another
        partition. We symlink it to a directory on a memory/viritual memory
        filesystem (specifically Solaris' tmpfs). If you use a tmpfs type
        filesystem, make sure that you have sufficient memory/swap to do
        this. 

      * /var/imap/deliverdb - If you enable duplicate delivery suppression,
        each time a mail message is delivered it needs to lock the database
        and check to see if the message-id has been seen already. If you
        require really high throughput delivery, you may want to disable
        this feature. However, disabling this feature also disables Sieve
        support. 

        We run with it enabled and it doesn't significantly impact our
        performance. 

      * /var/imap/mailboxes - Updating this file can be fairly expensive,
        especially if it gets large. Things get even worse if your
        operating system doesn't have a good mmap() implementation. Other
        than trying to put /var/imap on its own disk, there really isn't a
        good short term solution to this. 

        It should not be hard to move this from a flat file to some other
        database. If you are interested in doing this work, send mail to
        cyrus-bugs+@andrew.cmu.edu. 

        (at this moment in time) We have 95105 entries in our mailboxes
        file (4.4MB). It resides on a Seagate 7200rpm Fast/Wide disk off of
        a Sun QLGC Fast-Wide sbus card. We haven't experienced any
        significant problem as a result of this though there have been
        other reports. 

      * /var/spool/mqueue - Sendmail can be pretty harsh on the spool
        partition. Having this on a separate disk is usually a good idea.
