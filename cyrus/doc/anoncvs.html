    <h1>Cyrus IMAP: Anonymous CVS Access</h1>

    This file is for those who are reading Cyrus sources via anonymous CVS,
    or those who would like to.
    
    If you're someone who would like to work with the source code and get more
    frequent updates, keeping in mind that we take some liberties with proper
    CVS use, you might want to get Cyrus via anonymous CVS.
    
    <blockquote>
      <b>
	If you're not a programmer, please don't do this.  If you're not at
	least a little experienced with C, configure, and IMAP, please stick
	with the tarball releases at ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/.
      </b>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      To get to the repository, get a version of CVS with client-server support
      (anything remotely recent has this, I think) and do this:

    <p>
      <tt>
	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.andrew.cmu.edu:/cvs login <br>
        <i>(enter "anonymous" as the password)</i> <br>
	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.andrew.cmu.edu:/cvs co -d cyrus-imapd
	cyrus<br>

      </tt>

      (the first -d specifies the CVSROOT, in this case, our CVS server, and a
      path to the CVS repository; co says "check out", -d says "and stick it
      in the directory cyrus-imapd", and "cyrus" specifies the "cyrus"
      collection).  The password is "anonymous".
      
    <p>
      You will need autoconf (v2.12) to build CVS from the repository because
      we don't keep the configure script in the repository, along with the
      usual tools to build Cyrus (a compiler, a Unix box, a network.)
      
    <p>
      Read access to the repository is availible to anyone via
      cvs.andrew.cmu.edu.  Write access is availible to only a few people at
      CMU.
    
    <p>
      Please note that the version in the repository is not the version we are
      running.  We have a seperate system that resembles version control for
      releases of software on the Andrew system, and sometimes changes don't
      get propigated back to CVS.
    
    <p>
      What is here is supposed to be stable.  It's supposed to work, and
      compile, and not have amazingly broken changes that can't possibly work.
      But that may not be the case--and since you decided to use CVS, you
      shouldn't complain when something doesn't work.  You should submit a
      patch.
      
    <p>
      There is no warranty on the Cyrus software.
      There is no warranty on anything in CVS, and even less of a guarantee
      of it working.  (There.  You've been warned.)
      
<p>Please refer to <a href="feedback.html">Sending Feedback</a> if you
would like to submit a bug, feature request or (best of all) patch.

    <p>
      Thanks to Ryan Troll for putting the time in to make the CVS server
      work and actually documenting it.
