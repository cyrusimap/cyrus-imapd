<h1>Cyrus and Netnews
</h1>
<body>

<b><i>Note that the NNTP support in Cyrus is still relatively young in
the grand scheme of things, and has not been tested under a heavy
Usenet load.  That being said, the code appears to be stable and is
currently running in production serving 50-60 newsgroups with a volume
of about 6000 messages per day.</i></b>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Cyrus has the ability to export Usenet via IMAP and/or export shared
IMAP mailboxes via NNTP.  This is made possible by a new NNTP daemon
which is included with Cyrus.

<p>This document assumes that you have successfully been able to setup
your Cyrus IMAP server.  If you have not already done so, please refer
to the rest of the documentation.  This document also assumes that you
are familiar with Usenet and shared IMAP mailboxes.

<p>There is a <a href=netnews.png>diagram</a> that shows the interactions of
the various components of the NNTP support in Cyrus which may be
helpful in understanding the "big picture".<p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
You will need to build Cyrus IMAPd with the <tt>--enable-nntp</tt> configure
option.  This builds nntpd and the associated utilities.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
Obviously you must have a newsfeed from your ISP or Usenet provider.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
The first thing that must be done is to decide where your newsgroup
mailboxes will reside, either at the toplevel of your hierarchy (eg,
<tt>comp.mail.imap</tt>) or rooted elsewhere (eg,
<tt>netnews.comp.mail.imap</tt>).  If your newsgroup mailboxes are not
at the toplevel of your hierarchy, then you must specify the parent
with the <tt>newsprefix</tt> in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>.  Using the
example above, <tt>newsprefix</tt> would be set to <tt>netnews</tt>.

<p>You must create a mailbox for each newsgroup that you would like to
receive/export before the newsgroups can be used.  If some groups are
private, be sure to set the ACLs accordingly.  The <tt>tools/???</tt>
script can be used to help facilitate mass creation of newsgroup
mailboxes.

<h3>Receiving articles</h3>
In order to receive usenet articles, you must make sure that the Cyrus
<tt>nntpd</tt> service is enabled in <tt>cyrus.conf</tt>.  The
<tt>master/conf/normal.conf</tt> and <tt>master/conf/prefork.conf</tt>
sample configs both include entries for <tt>nntpd</tt> (disabled by
default).

<p>Whenever <tt>nntpd</tt> receives an article, it automatically adds a
To: header with email addresses corresponding to the newsgroups
that the article is destined for (eg, post+comp.mail.imap).  The
presence of this header makes it easier for email clients to
post/reply to the newsgroup.  The "pseudo" user that is used when
constructing the email address can be specified with the
<tt>newspostuser</tt> option in <tt>imapd.conf</tt> (default = "post").

<h4>Push (traditional) feeds</h4>
If your usenet peer will be pushing articles to you, no further
configuration is necessary, beyond letting your peer access your Cyrus
server on port 119 (nntp).

<h4>Pull (suck) feeds</h4>
If you prefer to pull articles from your peer (and your provider
allows it), then you can use the <tt>fetchnews</tt> utility which will
use the NNTP NEWNEWS command to retrieve articles from your peer and
feed them to your Cyrus server. You will probably want to configure
<tt>fetchnews</tt> as an EVENT in <tt>cyrus.conf</tt> to be called
periodically (eg, once an hour, every 15 minutes, etc).

<h4>imapfeed</h4>
Alternatively, if you already have an INN v2.3 server in-house you can
use the included <tt>imapfeed</tt> utility (written by the authors of
Cyrus) to feed articles to your Cyrus server via LMTP.  Consult the
INN documentation for further details.

<h4>Control Messages</h4>
Control messages are accepted, parsed and delivered to the
corresponding <tt>control.*</tt> pseudo-group (eg,
<tt>control.newgroup</tt>, <tt>control.cancel</tt>, etc) if it exists,
so that they may be reviewed by an administrator.

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Automatic execution of control messages is currently disabled until
PGP verification and ACL checking are implemented (hopefully by v2.2.1).

<h3>Reading/Posting articles</h3>
In order to have articles posted by your local users propagate to the
outside world, you must specify the name of your usenet peer with the
<tt>newspeer</tt> option in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>.  This is the host
that <tt>nntpd</tt> contacts to feed outgoing articles.  Also note
that you may specify an optional wildmat to filter which groups will
be fed (see <tt>imapd.conf(5)</tt> for details).

<h4>News clients</h4>

If anonymous logins are disabled (default) in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>,
then your news clients will have to be configured to login with a
username and password, otherwise they will not be allowed to post.
Furthermore, if plaintext logins are disabled in <tt>imapd.conf</tt>,
then you might have to configure your news clients to use SSL/TLS and
enable the <tt>nntps</tt> service in <tt>cyrus.conf</tt>.

<p>If you want to allow your news clients to use the NNTP NEWNEWS
command, you will have to enable the <tt>allownewnews</tt> option in
<tt>imapd.conf</tt>.

<h4>Email clients</h4>
If you are exporting Usenet via IMAP, then your users will reply to
and post articles via SMTP.  In order for these messages to be fed
into your server (and subsequently to the outside world) you need to
use an email to news gateway, such as <a
href=http://www.ossp.org/pkg/tool/lmtp2nntp/>lmtp2nntp</a>.  You need
to configure your MTA (Sendmail, Postfix, etc) so that
<tt>lmtp2nntp</tt> is used as the local mailer whenever it receives a
news article.  A simple rule for doing this in Sendmail is shown
below:

<pre>
<kdb># mail addressed to post+ goes to lmtp2nntp@localhost
LOCAL_RULE_0
Rpost + $+ < @ $=w . >		$#lmtp2nntp $@ localhost $: $1
</kbd></pre>

<p>For other configurations, consult the <tt>lmtp2nntp</tt> and
documentation and your MTA documentation.

<p><b>NOTE:</b> If anonymous logins are disabled (default) in
<tt>imapd.conf</tt>, then you should configure <tt>lmtp2nntp</tt> to
use its "feed" operation mode.

<h3>Expiring articles</h3>
To expire usenet articles on a regular basis, you should use the <tt>expirenews</tt> utility.  This utility both expunges articles from their mailboxes and prunes message-ids from <tt>netnews.db</tt>.  The <tt>master/conf/normal.conf</tt> and <tt>master/conf/prefork.conf</tt> sample configs both include EVENT entries for <tt>expirenews</tt> (disabled by default).
