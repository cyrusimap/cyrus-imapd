                   Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.15

      * fixed a longstanding bug in quota that would affect people with
        unusual top-level hierarchy, fix by John Darrow,
        John.P.Darrow@wheaton.edu. 
      * some important fixes to db3 interface code, by Walter Wong,
        wcw@cmu.edu, prompted by complaints from Scott Adkins,
        adkinss@ohio.edu. 
      * fixed some memory leaks in imclient and in the Perl IMAP module,
        prompted by Toni Andjelkovic, toni@soth.at. 
      * fixed a longstanding authentication error in the Perl IMAP module,
        should remove pesky extra Password: prompt. 
      * fixed some allocation bugs in the managesieve perl module. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.14

      * fixed memory management bugs in imapd, lmtpd that were being hit
        due to the connection reuse code and causing subtle and annoying
        problems. 
      * we now clean up better when deleting a user 
      * fixed an endian bug in ipurge 
      * pop3d now can also reuse processes. 
      * fix a bug in imclient that would strike when cyradm specifies a
        mechanism on the command-line. (SASL mechanism names aren't case
        sensitive.) 
      * fix some bugs in handling SIGHUP in master 
      * fix a couple of goofs in Admin.pm 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.13

      * fixed a silly bug with reusing SSL connections 
      * lmtpd can now service multiple clients in sequence, hopefully
        improving performance 
      * changed how Berkeley db databases are opened, hopefully lessening
        the chance of deadlock and improving performance 
      * fixed a couple of memory leaks 
      * lessened the chance of a race condition during index_check() 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.12

      * refactored code so less duplication 
      * added alternate config file for partial virtual domain support 
      * pop3d can now disable USER/PASS commands. 
      * STARTTLS now accepts a SSLv23 hello but doesn't allow SSLv23 to be
        negotiated. 
      * imtest no longer buffers to aid use as an automated layer. 
      * master now supports maximum number of service processes via the
        "maxchild" modifier. 
      * fixed a bug in the Sieve string lexer. 
      * one imapd process can now service multiple clients in sequence,
        eliminating a large number of forks. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.11

      * portability fixes involving setrlimit() 
      * fixed compiler warnings 
      * the STARTTLS command will only accept TLSv1 now, not SSLv2/v3. The
        imaps port is unaffected by this change. 
      * timsieved no longer returns garbage strings. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.9

      * some small memory savings 
      * the "fud" daemon once again works correctly 
      * the IDLE extension now uses signals correctly 
      * problems with libwrap have been resolved 
      * imapd and pop3d now log connections protected via TLS. 
      * efficiency improvements when searching for a particular message-id 
      * fixed an envelope-parsing bug affecting SORT and THREAD 
      * made RENAME keep the same mailbox uniqueid, preserving seen state
        across renames 
      * STOREing flags to multiple messages in one command is now more
        efficient 
      * RENAME now preserves the ACL 
      * LIST is now as efficient as Cyrus v1.6, modulo Berkeley DB issues. 
      * Sieve zephyr notifications are now correct. 
      * crash in reconstruct now fixed. 
      * man pages added for cyrus.conf, master, lmtpd, idled, ctl_mboxlist,
        and ctl_deliver. 
      * master can now listen on specific interfaces 
      * master can now reread /etc/cyrus.conf on SIGHUP. 
      * timsieved now uses symlinks instead of hard links. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.8

      * remembered to update this file 
      * bug in Cyrus::IMAP perl module affecting cyradm's setquota fixed 
      * portability fix with socklen_t 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.7

      * preliminary implementation of the IDLE extension (Ken Murchison,
        ken@oceana.com). 
      * THREAD=REFERENCES now part of the normal build. 
      * tweaks to the installation documentation and suggested Sendmail
        configuration 
      * portability fixes and other small bugfixes 
      * added "-a" flag to lmtpd 
      * master process can now export statistics about running processes
        via UCD SNMP AgentX 
      * many fixes to Cyrus Murder-related code 
      * fixes to perl code, especially the Sieve interface. added an IMSP
        interface to the perl code, but it still needs work. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.6

      * some number of random static variables eliminated, to save on
        memory footprint 
      * recursive RENAME was a little to eager; fixed. RENAME will also
        give the client a hint that a sub-RENAME failed. (mostly probably
        useful for cyradm, but cyradm doesn't take advantage of it yet.) 
      * THREAD=X-JWZ has turned into THREAD=REFERENCES (Ken Murchison) 
      * DELETE wasn't failing cleanly in database code; fixed. 
      * off-by-one bug in seen_db fixed. 
      * starting/committing/aborting transactions now logged more correctly
        in cyrsudb_db3 
      * master will now accept port numbers instead of just service names
        in cyrus.conf. also logs even more verbosely (see bug #115.) 
      * libwrap_init() is now inside the loop, since i don't quite
        understand the semantics of libwrap calls. 
      * setquota in cyradm now behaves more sanely (and gives correct usage
        message). 
      * bugfixes to the managesieve client perl api. (still needs work.) 
      * small fixes in timsieved. 
      * added a "make dist" target so i won't dread releases as much. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server since 2.0.5

      * APPEND now honors the \Seen flag. 
      * mailboxes file can once again be a flat text file. (compile-time
        choice) 
      * subscriptions file can be flat text or berkeley db. likewise for
        seen state. 
      * unfortunately, the format of the mailboxes file has changed. 
      * implementation of "JWZ" threading, a first pass on the forthcoming
        THREAD=REFERENCES. 
      * bugfixes in libacap. 
      * bugfixes in other Murder related functionality. 
      * removal of dead code. 
      * will now look in CYRUS_PREFIX/etc/imapd.conf if there's no
        /etc/imapd.conf. 
      * more paranoid implementation of ID. 
      * more descriptive lmtp errors. 
      * finished implementation of LMTP 8BITMIME. 
      * fixed minor bugs in pop3d. 
      * small test suite for cyrusdb backends added in lib/test/. 
      * added -DPERL_POLLUTE to the perl compilation to deal with Perl 5.6. 
      * small additions to the Sieve library. 
      * As usual, owe lots of thanks to Ken Murchison for his hard work and
        awesome implementations. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server SINCE 2.0.4

      * Now should work with Berkeley DB 3.1, but does not auto-upgrade 3.0
        databases (and, in fact, I haven't written any upgrade software
        yet). 
      * SORT and THREAD should now function correctly. 
      * Some configure fixes. 
      * Some fixes for possible race conditions in initializing services
        and database structures. 
      * Some non-gcc compile fixes with structure initialization. 
      * Some non gcc compile fixes with structure initialization. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server SINCE 2.0.3

      * fixed mbpath and ipurge. Thanks to Alain Turbide for the bug
        report. 
      * configure: removed mmap_private.c; it was buggy, and not worth
        supporting. 
      * configure: improvements in detecting libwrap, typos fixed in
        detecting libsasl. 
      * Merged the acapsieve library into libacap. 
      * improvements to the ACAP API. 
      * invariant checks added to the skiplist code. 
      * bugfix in TCL cyradm. 
      * acapmbox.c: bugfixes in handling acap connections. 
      * fix the size given for a unix socket address (changes throughout
        the code), patch thanks to Vladimir Kravchenko, jimson@null.ru. 
      * rewrote deliver to use the generic LMTP API in lmtpengine.c.
        Likewise, implemented the client-side API in lmtpengine.c. (Still
        need to implement AUTH.) 
      * added SORT and THREAD support (Ken Murchison, ken@oceana.com.) 
      * In checking an APPEND command, we were rejecting valid system flags
        and accepting invalid ones. 
      * minor bug fixes to proxyd. 
      * large amount of debugging code added to target-acap. 
      * build fixes to Perl programs. 
      * allow plaintext authentication to timsieved. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server in 2.0 

      * The mailboxes file is now a transaction-protected Berkeley
        database. 
      * The core delivery process has been moved to lmtpd. deliver is now a
        simple wrapper to create an LMTP transaction. 
      * master process, responsible for spawning services (imapd, lmtpd,
        etc.) and for routine housekeeping. Optionally, it can use libwrap
        to allow or deny connections. 
      * ACAP (Application Configuration Access Protocol) support for Cyrus
        Murder: IMAP Aggregator. 
      * Sieve enhancements: regular expressions, notifications,
        automatically setting IMAP flags. 
      * SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) support for monitoring
        usage (e.g. number of users logged in) as well as for instrumenting
        protocol usage (e.g. number of times CREATE has been called). 
      * Perl version of cyradm contributed by Brandon Allbery
        (allbery@ece.cmu.edu). Eventually we expect to transition to the
        Perl version away from the TCL version. 
      * Bugfix in modified UTF-7 processing (for mailbox names). Bugfix in
        index_searchcacheheader(). 
      * Implemented the extension MULTIAPPEND. 
      * RENAME is now hierarchical. 
      * The right that controls whether a mailbox may be deleted is now
        "c". (It used to be "d".) 
      * An additional backend for seen state has been created, seen_db. It
        stores seen state in a per-user database. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.20 

      * Some fixes to the TLS support to gracefully degrade service. 
      * Sieve now correctly re-sieves messages that are received with
        identical message-ids, but different envelopes. It also obeys
        plus-addressing on keep actions. (Fixes by Ken Murchison,
        ken@oceana.com.) 
      * The server wasn't correctly calculating the percentage of quota
        used when deciding whether or not to issue a warning. 
      * Implemented single-instance store: deliver, when using LMTP, will
        only store one copy of a message per partition, and hard link it
        among multiple users. Sites with a large number of partitions could
        see a performance decrease. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.19 

      * Added STARTTLS support; requires OpenSSL. 
      * Sieve now uses MDNs to reject messages instead of DSNs, conforming
        to the latest Sieve specification. (Ken Murchison) 
      * The duplicate delivery database expiration (deliver -E) was
        deleting all entries; fixed. 
      * imtest is now a little smarter about parsing the protocol to avoid
        synchronization errors prior to authentication. 
      * timsieved's parser is now written in C; should be no noticeable
        changes, but should make compiling it much easier. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.16 

      * Fix to enclosed message parsing (thanks to John Myers). 
      * When trying to skip over non-synchronizing literals during error
        recovery, the IMAP server never stopped eating. Fixed. 
      * Added with-sasldir as a configure option. 
      * Fixed a bug in cyradm when it got the CAPABILITY list. 
      * Fixed bugs relating to the incomplete SASLfication of deliver. 
      * Fixed bugs in deliver relating to duplicate delivery suppression
        and Sieve vacation functionality. 
      * Fixed a memory leak in deliver. 
      * When looking for SASL options, imapd wasn't defaulting to the
        option without the plugin name requesting it. This caused PLAIN
        authentications to incorrectly fail. 
      * Changed the expiration time of pts entries to 3 hours; only affects
        sites using krb_pts as the authorization method. 
      * Fixed some bugs in imclient; mostly affects cyradm. 
      * Fixed a bug in the Sieve lexer and improved the usefulness of the
        Sieve test program. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.13 

      * An annoying memory management bug in imclient was fixed and it's
        efficiency was improved somewhat. 
      * Added the sieve client (installsieve) and server (timsieved) for
        getting sieve scripts onto the server and managing them once they
        are there. 
      * The default Sieve script layout has changed to
        sievedir/u/user/default; this supports multiple Sieve scripts per
        user with the ability to switch between them. 
      * Fixed the kerberos-to-local-host bug (patch by Greg Hudson,
        ghudson@mit.edu). 
      * Started changes to deliver to support LMTP AUTH. 
      * Improved the error messages logged when authentication fails. 
      * Fixed a bug dealing with argument processing in the arbitron
        program. 
      * pop3d now correctly supports SASL AUTH. 
      * imtest will no longer prompt for authentication or authorization
        names; instead, it defaults to the current Unix user. Override on
        the command line. 
      * Likewise, cyradm will no longer prompt. It now accepts "-m" to
        specify what SASL mechanism to use, and the pwcommand option to
        authenticate should once again work when used non-interactively. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.10 

      * Changed the sieve option in the configure script to
        --disable-sieve. 
      * Updated reconstruct and quota to check for hashed imap spool
        directories correctly. 
      * deliver now will not use Sieve if duplicate delivery suppression is
        disabled. There was also a bug that caused the duplicate delivery
        database to be checked even if dupelim was disabled. 
      * deliver now uses tm_gmtoff if available to check for the local
        timezone. 
      * The default format for reading information from INN has changed. If
        you use INN to feed imapd news, you must change your "newsfeeds"
        file to contain 

        collectnews!:*:Tf,WO:collectnews

      * The dohash script now takes a "-i" option to run interactively and
        the "-f" option to issue warnings instead of fatal errors. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.1-BETA 

      * cyradm should now work with all mechanisms (it now handles empty
        challenges and responses). 
      * Fixed deliver to deal with arbitrarily long headers 
      * COPY for non-existent sequence numbers returns NO; this contrasts
        to UID COPY, which always returns OK. 
      * FETCH for non-existent sequence numbers returns NO; this contrasts
        to UID FETCH, which always returns OK. 
      * Fixed a misleading BAD responses to commands that take sequences. 
      * Added UIDNEXT untagged response to a SELECT (from
        draft-crispin-imapv-07.txt). 
      * pop3d now correctly passes SASL configuration options to libsasl. 
      * imtest now correctly flushes the server's output to the screen. 
      * Added more hashing using a simple but stupid algorithm. Now
        whenever there is a mailbox access, quota access, or subscription
        access, it goes through a hash function. this is done to help
        reduce the number of files/directories in any given directory. 
      * Added the binary mbpath. Given a mailbox name, this binary will
        print the filesystem path to that mailbox. This way if you have
        multiple partitions and hashing turned out, you don't have to spend
        as many mental cycles figuring out where the actual directory is. 
      * deliver now checks sieveusehomedir and sievedir in the config file
        to determine where to look for sieve scripts. 
      * ptloader now has a workaround for afs 3.5. 
      * clarified an error message in message.c when an unexpected end of
        file is encountered. 
      * fixed some random memory leaks in deliver. 
      * fixed a fairly major bug in prot_fill. it was performing
        incorrectly when reading only a single character. 
      * fixed a bug in how imtest looked for OK or NO. 
      * fixed a memory leak in imapd. 
      * imapd now allows any user (or member of a group) listed in
        "proxyservers" to proxy. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.6.0-BETA 

      * fixed stupid bug in imapd 
      * fixed sasl/config.c interaction 
      * fixed use of stat in imtest 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.24 

      * ANSI C is now required. 
      * imtest's interface has changed, to allow for SASL authentication.
        Sorry, but it had to happen. It now also includes a timing test
        (-z) which we use to test the SASL layers. 
      * imtest no longer uses a non-synchronizing literal with LOGIN, so it
        should work against all IMAP servers. 
      * The prot layer now uses SASL for encryption and authentication.
        This changed a large amount of code, and some build procedures. 
      * As a side effect of SASL, --enable-static-libraries now doesn't do
        anything. We are considering compiling cyrus with libtool to change
        this. 
      * Error codes returned by programs have changed, and programs return
        EX_TEMPFAIL far more than they used to. This is because Sendmail
        considers most not-EX_TEMPFAIL errors permanent; now, if it may not
        be permanent, EX_TEMPFAIL is returned. (See lib/exitcodes.h.) 
      * Two bugs fixed: UID FETCH's with no messages in range now return
        OK, not BAD. And an obscure bug in LIST case sensitivity is fixed. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.19 

      * Most of the charset.c code (and mkchartable.c code) has been
        replaced thanks to John Myers). 
      * Bug fix in message.c to look up headers in the cache when they're
        in the cache correctly; thanks to Chris Newman for the fix. 
      * Code cleanup here and there (thanks to Bruce Balden). 
      * Annoying (and confusing) lines in syslog every time a message was
        delivered if deliver was compiled using dbm saying that deliver was
        "unable to fetch entry" have been removed. 
      * Content-Disposition lines were being parsed improperly. If they had
        no optional arguments, they were being ignored as if they were
        syntactically incorrect. This is fixed, but imapd will continue to
        serve wrong information unless cyrus.caches are rebuilt (with
        reconstruct) for any message that was added to the mailbox before
        this bug was fixed. 
      * The arbitron program now takes a mailbox pattern argument for the
        mailbox to run on. The manpage always said it did anyway. 
      * Uninitialized variable fixed in imapd.c with the shutdown file
        code. 
      * Minor tweaks to purify build config. 
      * Fix minor memory leak in proc.c where procfname wasn't being
        free'd. 
      * Fix brain fart in auth_krb_pts.c where a CLOSE() was done to a DB
        handle BEFORE we access the data read from the DB database. This
        means we were copying free'd memory into the groups list. Note this
        only affects people using DB, AFS and ptloader. 
      * Committed minor syslog log level changes in ptloader and deliver. 
      * make distclean now does what it's supposed to. 
      * Possibly misnamed experimental --enable-static-libraries switch
        that tries to do a good job of building binaries with whatever
        static libraries are availible. If you use this, you do so at your
        own risk, and if it fails, we will disavow all knowledge of you and
        your team. Good luck, Jim. 
      * Add optional third argument to imtest for it to take input from a
        file. This is a gross hack. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.14

      * LIST now honors the reference argument. 

        This behavior can be turned off by a configuration option
        imapd.conf--which may be desirable because of certain clients that
        ask for a "mail directory" setting for IMAP which will now cause
        problems when it was ignored before. (The default is for the
        reference argument to be honored.) 
      * The arbitron program now takes a mailbox pattern argument for the
        mailbox to run on. The manpage always said it did anyway. 
      * Added --disable-server switch to optionally prevent compilation of
        server to help sites that just want client libraries (so cyradm and
        libcyrus can be compiled on remote systems without installing stuff
        into /usr/cyrus/bin, etc.) For now, the server is still configured
        in this case, and a Makefile is generated. This could change in
        future versions. 
      * Fixed a mmap leak in index.c in index_search_evaluate that caused
        problems on complex searches. Thanks to Jeff Schiller for pointing
        this out. Fixed a potential leak in mboxlist.c that happened if a
        rename went awry. Thanks to Chris Newman for pointing this out. 
      * Fixed a bug in LIST and LSUB code so that user.* mailboxes will be
        printed on every LIST instead of just the first one. 
      * Implemented the POP3 Extension Mechanism, RFC 2449, in order to
        advertise the capabilities already supported. 
      * Fixed a bug in mailbox.c that disallowed MUTF-7 representations of
        ASCII characters when it shouldn't have. (Thanks to John Myers for
        providing a fix and to Per Steinar Iversen for telling me that I
        didn't do it before.) 
      * More cleanup the ptloader/auth_krb_pts code. If you use Kerberos
        and IMSP, you *MUST* pick up cyrus-imspd-v1.5a6 (or newer). 
      * A few configure tweaks. 
      * Duplicate delivery changes: 

          * Split out duplicate delivery elimination to multiple files.
            This should help reduce the lock contention that normally
            occurs with this file. To not clutter config_dir, the files
            will be located in a subdirectory named deliverdb, for example
            /var/imap/deliverdb. If you don't make this directory, nothing
            bad will happen (other than duplicate delivery elimination will
            not work). 
          * The time value is now stored as an integer in native byte order
            as opposed to converting it to a string before it is stored in
            the database. 
          * checkdelivered() now obtains a read lock instead of a write
            lock when trying to check for duplicates. Only markdelivered()
            grabs a write lock. 

      * Added logic to cause cyradm to abort more cleanly if not given
        command line arguments in an interactive session. This gets rid of
        the dreaded application-specific intialization failed messages. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.11

      * The CREATE command now ignores a trailing hierarchy delimiter
        instead of ignoring the CREATE command. 
      * UIDPLUS is now always advertised in CAPABILITY and is always
        availible. The UIDPLUS extension is a set of optimizations using
        UID values instead of sequence numbers and is described in RFC
        2359. 
      * Cyrus no longer rejects messages with 8-bit characters in the
        headers. Rather than reject the message, characters with the 8th
        bit set are changed to 'X'. Internationalization in headers is
        supported by the mechanism specified in RFC 2047 (and RFC 1342). 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.10

      * If ENABLE_EXPERIMENT is set, the server no longer claims to support
        OPTIMIZE-1; instead, it claims to support UIDPLUS. The Getuids
        command has been removed since it is not in the UIDPLUS document
        (draft-myers-imap-optimize-03.txt). 
      * The checks for Tcl in configure are much smarter. The configure
        script asks tclsh where its configuration lives, then consults the
        shell scripts that have that information. This should work with 7.5
        or better, which is what the server requires anyway. (All the
        previous checks to look for Tcl libraries are gone; now, configure
        runs tclsh and asks it where the Tcl libraries are, then runs the
        shell scripts that are in that directory. Since the tclConfig.sh
        script may not be in that directory, it looks in .. as well.) 
      * The checks for com_err in configure are a little smarter and look
        to see if all the pieces are there before trying to use them. 
      * Added support for the NAMESPACE extension (if --enable-experiment
        is supplied). 
      * Added a "reject8bit" switch to imapd.conf. If set to "true",
        messages containing 8-bit-set characters in the headers are
        rejected (the previous behavior); if set to "false" or left to the
        default value, messages containing 8-bit-set characters have these
        characters changed to a constant character ('X'). 
      * Added the "fud" program. This is an interm hack designed to allow
        allow finger information to be retrieved for cyrus users. This is
        experimental and it is not recommend that services be built arround
        this feature, since it is likely to be removed in a future release
        of the IMAP server. 
      * Bug fix: User defined flags now work properly. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5.2

      * Fixed a bug with word alignment on Solaris using Kerberos compiled
        with Sun's CC. (Several patches were submitted; thanks to everyone
        who did so.) 
      * Patches from John Myers, including more glob fixes. 
      * Use the default hash function from DB. Note that this means that
        the existing delivered.db and ptscache.db is NOT compatible with
        this release. These files should be removed. 
      * Provide two debugging programs that dump the databases: ptdump and
        dump_deliverdb. 
      * Multiple changes to ptloader. added a bunch of flags; let it
        reauthenticate on its own; added support perl wrapper; added bunch
        of debugging information/output; bunch of other cleanups 
      * The mailboxes file is now closed if it isn't likely to be
        referenced, hopefully preventing old mailboxes files from hanging
        around in memory as frequently. 
      * Added a patch from Eric Hagberg to work around a possible deadlock
        condition in mboxlist.c where rename isn't atomic. 
      * Patch from John Myers to get rid of cyrus.seen corruption in
        bsearch_mem. 
      * Patch from John Myers and to allow ISO-8859-1 characters in mailbox
        names. 
      * Makedepend still runs, and still generates warnings, but these are
        squirrled away in makedepend.log. 
      * On mailbox delete, the server will no longer try and unlink ".."
        and "." as we got a report that it seriously breaks one file system
        (even as non-root). 
      * Added some support for Netscape's very misleading "Administrate My
        Mail" menu option in Communicator. Allows for a URL to be set in
        imapd.conf for the page to refer users to; needs to be turned on
        with --enable-netscapehack at compile time to enable it. 
      * Bug swap: imtest quotes password with a non-synchronizing literal
        in order to allow weird characters like ) in passwords. But it
        doesn't look to see if the server supports non-synchronizing
        literals. 
      * If the file "msg/motd" exists, the first line is now sent to
        clients upon login. 
      * Bug fix: to handle BODY[] properly when fetching news articles
        (truncation no longer occurs). (thanks to John Prevost) 
      * The makedepend supplied should now run on Solaris Intel. (thanks to
        Chris Newman) 
      * Added some hacks to pwcheck.c for Linux and Digital Unix where the
        default protections on the socket don't allow the cyrus user to
        read it. (thanks to Lyndon Nerenberg) 
      * Bug fix: Flags beginning with \ are system flags and users can only
        create the defined flags. The code to do this before was confused. 
      * The configure scripts and makefiles have some random fixes. 
      * Added a contrib directory for reasons of laziness in collecting
        patches, not all of which should be in the distribution. 
      * ptloader can now renew its AFS authentication by reading from a
        srvtab file. 
      * The configure script now looks for a libcom_err and can use an
        installed one if one exists. 
      * Other small bug fixes. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.5

      * Bug fix: RENAME corrupted mailboxes if they had been EXPUNGEd. (may
        have only happened with INBOX, which Pine tickles once a month.) 
      * Bug fix: auth_newstate now initializes its structures. 
      * Bug fix: pop3d.c, a printf was changed to prot_printf. 
      * Cyrus now sends X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME to alert clients that it
        is not handling RENAME in an IMAP4rev1 compliant manner. This will
        be fixed in a subsequent release. 
      * Bug fix: imclient_autenticate now does resolution on the hostname
        before authenticating to it. This caused problems when
        authenticating to an address that was a CNAME. 
      * Bug fix: LIST %.% (and other multiple hierarchy delimiter matches)
        works properly. Several other glob.c fixes are included as well. 
      * Bug fix: a fetch of exclusively BODY[HEADER.FIELDS...] should now
        work properly. 
      * Bug fix: reconstruct now considers a nonexistant INN news directory
        to be empty; this makes reconstruct fix the cyrus.* files in the
        imap news partition. 
      * Added a manpage for imclient. 
      * Fixed a few other minor bugs. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.4

      * Implemented the "IMAP4rev1" protocol commands. (The hierarchical
        behavior of RENAME, which was added late to the IMAP4rev1
        specification, is not implemented.) Changes the minor version
        number of the cyrus mailbox database format to 1. IMPORTANT: it is
        necessary to run the command "reconstruct -r" as the cyrus user
        after upgrading the Cyrus IMAP software from version 1.4 or
        earlier. 
      * If the file "msg/shutdown" exits in the configuration directory,
        the IMAP server will issue the first line in the file in an
        untagged BYE message and shut down. 
      * Permit SPACE in mailbox names. 
      * Permit the "modified UTF-7" internationalized mailbox name
        convention. 
      * "User opened mailbox" messages are now logged at the DEBUG level
        instead of the INFO level. 
      * Added -q (ignore quota) switch to deliver. 
      * New "krbck" program for diagnosing common kerberos problems. 
      * auth_unix no longer requires users to be in the passwd file. 
      * AUTHENTICATE command now reports the protection mechanism in use in
        the text of the tagged OK response 
      * Make MAILBOX_BADFORMAT and MAILBOX_NOTSUPPORTED temporary errors. 
      * Use the header cache for SEARCH HEADER 
      * Use "unspecified-domain" instead of server's hostname to fill out
        RFC 822 addresses without the "@domain" part. 
      * Make "reconstruct -r" with no args reconstruct every mailbox. 
      * The configure script now defaults to using unix_pwcheck instead of
        unix if the file /etc/shadow exists. 
      * The location of the pwcheck socket directory now defaults to
        "/var/ptclient/". It is controlled by the "--with-statedir=DIR"
        option, which defaults to "/var". 
      * Bug fix: by using an certain address form, one could deliver to a
        user's mailbox bypassing the ACL's. 
      * Bug fix: un-fold header lines when parsing for the ENVELOPE. 
      * Delete quota roots when deleting the last mailbox that uses them.
        Doesn't catch all cases, but should get over 99% of them. 
      * Implement plaintextloginpause configuration option, imposes
        artificial delay on plaintext password logins. 
      * Implement popminpoll configuration option, limits frequency of POP3
        logins. 
      * Implement AFS PT server group support. 
      * Remove persistence of POP3 LAST value and remove Status: hack 
      * Support the new ACL command set in the IMAP server. 
      * Bug fix: Have to initialize reply to 0 in pop3d. Was causing POP3
        server to occasionally drop the connection during authentication. 
      * Bug fix: The COPY command wasn't issuing a [TRYCREATE] when
        appropriate for sub-mailboxes of INBOX. 
      * Bug fix: Renaming a mailbox wasn't correctly changing its
        UIDVALIDITY. 
      * Bug fix: Renaming a mailbox to itself, in order to move it to a
        different partition, was not working correctly. 
      * Update the AUTH support in pop3d to conform to the latest draft
        specification. 
      * Update cyradm to use Tcl 7.5 instead of Tcl 7.4 
      * Re-implement large sections of the netnews support. It no longer
        requires modifications to INN, as it now expunges the index entries
        for expired/canceled articles upon select of the newsgroup. 
      * Implement newsspool configuration option, for separating the
        directories for the news spool and the various cyrus.* IMAP server
        index files. 
      * Bug fix: permit empty flag list in APPEND command 
      * Bug fix: deal with truncated Date: header values. 
      * Bug fix: memory mapping code, deal better with 0-length maps, since
        mmap() appears to crap out on that boundary condition. 
      * Portability fix: if no strerror, have to define NEED_SYS_ERRLIST. 
      * Bug fix: used append instead of lappend in cyradmin, preventing use
        of any port other than IMAP. 
      * When the client is streaming its commands, the IMAP server attempts
        to stream its tagged responses. 
      * Modify zephyr support to compile without Kerberos support. 
      * Add a bunch of prototype declararations to the code. 
      * In deliver, change the MULT support to instead use the LMTP syntax. 
      * imclient: support tagged intermediate replies and a default
        callback. 
      * Implement some experimental protocol extensions for optimizing
        disconnected use resynchronization. Most extensions are disabled by
        default. Client authors should contact info-cyrus@andrew.cmu.edu if
        they wish to experiment with these. 
      * In Makefiles, change $(AR) to ar -- HPUX make is defective. 
      * In deliver, use HAVE_LIBDB to select use of db over dbm 
      * Add map_stupidshared mapping module for older versions of Digital
        Unix. It's not quite as bad as HPUX, but... 
      * Bug fix: in imclient.c, don't free NULL pointers and don't call
        htons() on the output of getservbyname(). Have to abort sending the
        command if you get a tagged response when sending a literal. 
      * The auth_xxx routines now create/take a state argument instead of
        maintaining internal static state. 
      * Solaris mktime() is buggy in some releases. Create and use
        mkgmtime() for parsing date strings. 
      * Message parsing routines now use memory mapping, though they still
        copy data around in line-sized buffers. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.3

      * Implemented the "reconstruct -m" command, for reconstructing the
        mailboxes file. IMPORTANT: it is necessary to run the command
        "reconstruct -m" as the cyrus user after upgrading the Cyrus IMAP
        software from version 1.3 or earlier. We recommend you make a
        backup copy of the mailboxes file in the configuration directory
        before performing the conversion. 
      * Mailbox names are now case sensitive, not case insensitive. "INBOX"
        is the exception, and is treated as being case-insensitive. 
      * Personal mailboxes now appear to their owners as being under the
        "INBOX." hierarchy. For example, the mailbox "user.bovik.work"
        appears to the user "bovik" as "INBOX.work". The user may still
        refer to the mailbox with the name "user.bovik.work". 
      * Previously, the code used "anybody" as the name of the group that
        all users are in, but the documentation used the name "anyone".
        Changed the code to match the documentation. The name "anybody"
        will be canonicalized to the name "anyone". 
      * The install document now gives different recommended locations for
        the server databases. The recommended location of the configuration
        directory changed from "/usr/cyrus" to "/var/imap" and the
        recommended location of the default partition directory changed
        from "/usr/spool/cyrus" to "/var/spool/imap". It is NOT necessary
        to change the locations of these directories when upgrading from
        version 1.3 or earlier of the Cyrus IMAP server software. If you do
        wish to change the locations of these directories to match the new
        recommendations, simply rename the directories and change the
        appropriate values in your /etc/imapd.conf file. 
      * Created a "make install" rule. See the installation document for
        all the new corresponding configure options. Note the recommended
        location of the "imapd", "pop3d", and "deliver" programs has
        changed, this change needs to be reflected in the "inetd.conf" and
        "sendmail.cf" files. 
      * New "login_unix_pwcheck" module and "pwcheck" daemon, for improved
        shadow password support. See the "pwcheck/README.pwcheck" file in
        the distribution for details. 
      * Renamed the "login_unix_shadow" module to "login_unix_getspnam". 
      * Added a mail notification mechanism, using Zephyr. 
      * Added a feature to automatically create user IMAP accounts.
        Controlled by the "autocreatequota" config option. 
      * Added the "logtimestamps" config option, for putting timestamp
        information into protocol telemetry logs. 
      * Beefed up the Kerberos checks in Configure to ensure the DES
        library routines exist. 
      * On some systems, the "echo" command with no arguments emits a
        newline. Changed the installation document to instead use the
        "true" command to create the "mailboxes" file. 
      * Store a redundant copy of a mailbox's ACL in the cyrus.header file,
        so "reconstruct -m" may later use it as a backup. 
      * Had to remove the declaration of tcl_RcFileName for the latest
        version of Tcl. 
      * Make much more extensive use of memory mapping. Replace the binary
        search module with one that searches a memory mapped area. 
      * Replaced the yacc-based RFC822 address parser with a hand-coded
        one. 
      * Replaced the et (error table) libary with a version that doesn't
        require lex or yacc. Remove the lex/yacc checking from Configure. 
      * Safety feature: most programs now refuse to run as root. 
      * Bug fix: Issue [TRYCREATE] tag on COPY command when appropriate. 
      * Bug fix: The quoted-printable decoder wasn't ignoring trailing
        whitespace, as required by MIME. 
      * Bug fix: Don't spew cascade errors if the server gets an EOF
        during/after reading an APPEND literal. 
      * Bug fix: gmtmoff_gmtime.c was returning results with the wrong
        sign. 
      * Bug fix: imclient_send was appending spaces to %d and %u and the
        response parser was not handling responses that did not contain a
        space after the keyword. 
      * Bug fix: rmnews wasn't removing some (un-indexed) article files
        correctly. 
      * Completely disabled the dropoff code for now. It will be completely
        replaced when IMSP integration is implemented 
      * Added workaround for the Linux mkdir() problem. 
      * In Configure, use a more direct test for a working shared-memory
        mmap 
      * In collectnews, avoid O(n**2) behavior when processing articles
        that have already expired. 
      * Bug fix: append_addseen() would screw up if no messages were
        previously seen. 
      * Added the CMU-specific amssync and cmulocal directories. 
      * Use memmove instead of bcopy. 
      * Implemented the first pass of SMTP/MULT support in deliver. 
      * Added cacheid parameter to auth_setid(), for AFS PT server support. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.2

      * Fixed bug in character set code that broke text searches. Sites
        which care about searching headers need to reconstruct their
        existing mailboxes. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.1-Beta

      * Add support for UIDVALIDITY special information token. 
      * Add syncnews and arbitron programs. 
      * Redo duplicate delivery elimination in deliver. 
      * Bug fixed: Must re-read files after acquiring a lock. Cannot trust
        the mtime of a file to increment when writing the file--file could
        be written to multiple times in the same second. 
      * Bug fixed: EXAMINE command should not affect \Recent status. 
      * Update the user's \Recent high-water-mark when we report new
        messages. 
      * Portability changes 
      * Upgrade to autoconf 2.1 
      * Allow privacy to be turned off at compile-time with
        --disable-privacy configure switch. 
      * Fix typo in cyradm preventing "all" from being recognized. 
      * Include map_private.c memory mapping module for systems like HPUX
        which have half-working mmap() implementations. 
      * Switch to using UTF-8 for internal search format. Sites which care
        about internationalized searching of headers need to reconstruct
        all their existing mailboxes. 
      * Fix some errors in the iso-8859-* tables. 
      * Add and correct a bunch of case-independence mappings in the
        character tables. 
      * First pass at implementing the STATUS extension; disabled for
        release. 
      * First pass at implementing IMAP/IMSP server integration. Not ready
        for general use. 
      * Add new_cred and free_cred mechanisms to authentication modules. 
      * Don't complain when doing "reconstruct -r foo" and foo isn't a
        mailbox. 
      * Add IMAP_QUOTAROOT_NONEXISTENT error code. 
      * Bug fix: Avoid divide by zero when quota is zero 
      * Bug fix: In an error case of the ACL handling code, we have to
        restore tab before breaking out of loop. 
      * Fix file descriptor leak in quota system. 
      * Change a bunch of int variables to unsigned. 
      * Better error reporting on reads that end up short. 

Changes to the Cyrus IMAP Server Since Version 1.0-Beta

      * Improved installation document. 
      * New "cyradm" administrative client. 
      * Changed the syslog facility from "local4" to "local6". 
      * Removed the renounce setuid check in "deliver". The "deliver"
        program must now be non-executable by other. 
      * Fixed a typo in the parsing of SEARCH DELETED. (This bug constantly
        got tripped by newer C-clients.) 
      * Redesigned the implementation of SEARCH CHARSET.
        Sites that wish to search for non-ASCII characters in the headers
        of existing mailboxes must run reconstruct on all their mailboxes
        after upgrading to this version. 
      * Added AUTH and KPOP support to the POP3 server. 
      * Added search support for the ISO-2022-JP character set. 
      * Replaced the search engine with a partial Boyer-Moore algorithm. 
      * Special-case optimized searching US-ASCII text. 
      * Fixed a bug which caused the message parser to spin-loop on a
        particular degenerate invalid-MIME case. 
      * Fixed a performance bug in the message parser. 
      * Tracked last-minute changes to the IMAP4 protocol. 
      * Fixed a bug in UNSUBSCRIBE which caused too many subscriptions to
        be removed. 
      * Added a bunch more "configure" options. 
      * Ported to HPUX. 
      * Fixed a bug in the LIST/LSUB \Noselect code. 
      * Fixed bug in the globbing code which caused the "*%" pattern to
        work incorrectly. 
      * Client-side Kerberos support is now conditionalized on
        HAVE_ACTE_KRB, which is set by configure. 
      * Fixed some invalid buffer-alignment assumptions in the Kerberos
        code. 
      * Made the lexers compatible with flex. Configure now looks for and
        prefers to use flex and bison/byacc. 
      * Made the IMAP server check for the existence of the mailboxes file
        upon startup, in order to give a more informative error message for
        this common configuration error. 
      * Fixed other minor bugs.
