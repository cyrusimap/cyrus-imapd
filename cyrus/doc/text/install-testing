Testing the IMAP Server

    To test the IMAP server, reboot and perform the following steps (all of
    these samples use "foobar" as the IMAP server name). A list of answers
    to common installation problems is maintained in
    http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/imapd/install-FAQ. 

     1. From your normal account, telnet to the IMAP port on the server
        you're setting up: 

           telnet foobar imap

        If your server is running, you'll get the following message: 

           Trying 128.2.232.95...
           Connected to foobar.andrew.cmu.edu.
           Escape character is '^]'.
           * OK foobar.andrew.cmu.edu Cyrus IMAP4 v2.0.0 server ready

        Any message other than one starting with "* OK" means there is a
        problem. To terminate the connection, type ". logout". 

        Naturally the version number should match the version you just
        installed. 

     2. Use "imtest" to test logging in with plaintext passwords: 

           /usr/local/bin/imtest -m login foobar

        If you want to specify a different user, do: 

           /usr/local/bin/imtest -m login -a USER foobar

        If your server is running, you'll get the following message: 

           % /usr/local/bin/imtest -m login foobar
           S: * OK mail1.andrew.cmu.edu Cyrus IMAP4 v2.0.0 server ready
           C: C01 CAPABILITY
           S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 ACL QUOTA LITERAL+ NAMESPACE UIDPLUS 
           X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME NO_ATOMIC_RENAME AUTH=GSSAPI AUTH=ANONYMOUS 
           AUTH=KERBEROS_V4 UNSELECT
           S: C01 OK Completed
           Password: 
           + go ahead
           L01 OK User logged in
           Authenticated.
           Security strength factor: 0

        Any message other than one starting with a "L01 OK" means there is
        a problem. If the test fails, a more specific error message should
        be written through syslog to the server log. To terminate the
        connection, type ". logout". 
     3. You should now test the server with each of the various
        authentication mechanisms you have installed. The supported
        mechanisms are listed in the CAPABILITY line: 

          * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 ACL QUOTA LITERAL+ NAMESPACE UIDPLUS 
          X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME NO_ATOMIC_RENAME AUTH=ANONYMOUS
          AUTH=KERBEROS_V4 AUTH=DIGEST-MD5 AUTH=CRAM-MD5 UNSELECT
          . OK Completed

        Each of the mechanism names is preceded by a 'AUTH='. For this
        example the ANONYMOUS, KERBEROS_V4, DIGEST-MD5, and CRAM-MD5
        mechanisms are available. If a mechanism does not appear that you
        wish to use, examine the libsasl log messages. Generally, if a
        mechanism does not appear, it means it failed to initialize. (For
        example, if the server is unable to access the srvtab file the
        KERBEROS_V4 mechanism will refuse to load.) 

        Plaintext login is a special case: the PLAIN SASL mechanism is only
        advertised under an encrypted connection. However, plaintext logins
        are available (as long as you haven't disabled plaintext) by using
        -m login(as above). 

        To terminate the imtest connection, type ". logout". 

        Once you are satisfied with the authentication mechanism list you
        should attempt to log in with each of those mechanisms. Run imtest
        specifying which mechanism you would like to use. 

           /usr/local/bin/imtest -m KERBEROS_V4 foobar
           C: C01 CAPABILITY
           S: * OK foobar.andrew.cmu.edu Cyrus IMAP4 v2.0.0 server ready
           S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 ACL QUOTA LITERAL+ NAMESPACE
           UIDPLUS X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME NO_ATOMIC_RENAME AUTH=ANONYMOUS
           AUTH=GSSAPI AUTH=KERBEROS_V4 UNSELECT
           S: C01 OK Completed
           C: A01 AUTHENTICATE KERBEROS_V4
           S: + wYcDAA==
           C: BAYBQU5EUkVXLkNNVS5FRFUAOCAm7F/Y+HabCzJ
              /UMtVcvWRjTohuq/USaCV6gYdkAU5DOcADAq
           S: + 0aAsUGQZhgQ=
           C: ADMe/cVivAYYzy1yd4Vojg==
           S: A01 OK Success (privacy protection)
           Authenticated.
           Security strength factor: 56

        Any message other than one starting with a "A01 OK" means there is
        a problem. If the test fails, a more specific error message is
        written through syslog to the server log. To terminate the
        connection, type ". logout". 

        See the libsasl documentation for a full description of all the
        mechanisms. It is also possible to support "security layers"
        (privacy or integrity protected connections). By default, imtest
        uses the strongest layer available with the selected mechanism; use
        "-l" to choose an alternate layer.
