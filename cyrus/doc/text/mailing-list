info-cyrus mailing list

    We run a mailing list for users of Project Cyrus software. The
    info-cyrus@andrew.cmu.edu mailing list exists for the discussion of
    this server and other Cyrus software. Please do NOT send subscription
    requests to the list. 

    To subscribe: Send mail to majordomo@lists.andrew.cmu.edu to subscribe
    with the body of 'subscribe info-cyrus' (or just click the link above
    and that should just work). 

    An archive is availible via anonymous IMAP at
    imap://cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu/archive.info-cyrus. 

    A web archive is also available at
    http://asg.web.cmu.edu/archive/mailbox.php3?mailbox=archive.info-cyrus 

    If you are not subscribed to the list (or you are sending the message
    from a different address than the one which you are subscribed under),
    your message is directed to a human for approval. Unfortunately, the
    human does not always promptly process the message.
