<H1>              Cyrus IMAP Server:  Alternate Namespace</H1>

<p>This document describes the alternatives to the <a
href=overview.html#mboxname> standard</a> mailbox presentation
method.  These alternatives may be used together or independently.

<p>The namespace options do NOT change the rules governing the behavior of
mailboxes (as described in <a href=overview.html#mboxname>
overview.html</a>) or how mailboxes are stored on the filesystem.  The
mailboxes are ALWAYS stored using the <a href=overview.html#mboxname>
<tt>netnews</tt> convention</a> and <a href=overview.html#mboxnamestd>
internal namespace</a>.  When configured to use one (or both) of the
options below, the server simply translates mailbox names between the
internal  names and the external names when used by the client in the
IMAP protocol and in Sieve scripts.

<p>This design allows the namespace to be changed at runtime (even on
a running server) without having to reconfigure the server.  This also
means that one mailstore can support multiple namespaces if configured
correctly.

<p><b>NOTE:</b>  If you are upgrading an existing server which
uses <tt>timsieved</tt> to manage Sieve scripts and choose to enable
one of the namespace options, you should run the script
"<tt>tools/translatesieve</tt>" after configuring the namespace
option(s).  This script will translate the folder names in
<tt>fileinto</tt> actions.

<H2><a name="altname">Alternate Mailbox Namespace</a></H2>

<p>The alternate namespace allows a user's personal mailboxes to
appear as if they reside at the same level as that user's
<TT>INBOX</TT> as opposed to children of it. For example, if user
"<TT>bovik</TT>" had a personal "<TT>work</TT>" mailbox, it would
appear to user "<TT>bovik</TT>" as "<TT>work</TT>" instead of
"<TT>INBOX.work</TT>" as it would in the <a
href=overview.html#mboxnamestd> standard namespace</a>.

<p>This configuration requires that a special prefix be used for
shared folders (to distinguish them from personal folders) and for
accessing other users' folders.   By default, the prefix for shared
folders is "<tt>Shared Folders</tt>" and the prefix for other users
folders is "<tt>Other Users</tt>".  For example, a shared folder
"<tt>foo</tt>" in the <a href=overview.html#mboxnamestd> standard
namespace</a> would be presented as "<tt>Shared Folders.foo</tt>" in
the alternate namespace.

<p><b>NOTE:</b> All tools for administering the server, including
admins using cyradm, always use the <a href=overview.html#mboxnamestd>
internal namespace</a>.

<H3><a name="altnameconfig">Configuring the Alternate
Namespace</a></H3>

<p>To use the alternate namespace, turn on the <tt>altnamespace</tt>
option in <tt>/etc/imapd.conf</tt>.  The prefixes used for shared
folders and other users folders can be changed from the defaults by
setting the <tt>sharedrefix</tt> and <tt>userprefix</tt> options
respectively.

<H2><a name="unixhiersep">UNIX Hierarchy Convention</a></H2>

<p>The UNIX hierarchy convention uses the traditional UNIX separator
character ("/") to delimit levels of the mailbox hierarchy instead of
the <tt>netnews</tt> character (".").  For example, if user
"<tt>bovik</tt>" had a personal "<tt>work</tt>" mailbox, it would
appear to user "<tt>bovik</tt>" as "<tt>INBOX/work</tt>" in the
<a href=overview.html#mboxnamestd>standard namespace</a>.

<p> When the UNIX hierarchy convention is used, the "." character MAY
be used in mailbox names, including user names.  In order to maintain
backwards compatibility with the <a
href=overview.html#mboxnamestd>internal namespace</a>, all "."
characters are translated to a benign character (currently
"^") before any data is stored to disk.  For example, if user
"<tt>elmer.fudd</tt>" had a personal "<tt>rabbit.holes</tt>" mailbox,
it would be stored as "<tt>user.elmer^fud.rabbit^holes</tt>" in the <a
href=overview.html#mboxnamestd>internal namespace</a>.  It is
important to remember this phenomenon if/when reverting back to the
<tt>netnews</tt> hierarchy convention.

<H3><a name="unixhiersepconfig">Configuring the UNIX Hierarchy
Convention</a></H3>

<p>To use the UNIX hierarchy separator, turn on the
<tt>unixhierarchysep</tt> option in <tt>/etc/imapd.conf</tt>.
