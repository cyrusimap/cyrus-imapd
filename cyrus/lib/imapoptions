.SH NAME
imapd.conf \- IMAP configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR 
is the configuration file for the Cyrus IMAP server.  It defines
local parameters for IMAP. 
.PP
Each line of the \fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR file has the form
.IP
\fIoption\fR: \fIvalue\fR
.PP
where \fIoption\fR is the name of the configuration option being set
and \fIvalue\fR is the value that the configuration option is being
set to.
.PP
Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.
.PP
For boolean options, the values ``yes'', ``on'', ``t'', and ``1'' turn the
option on, the values ``no'', ``off'', ``f'', and ``0'' turn the option off.
.SH FIELD DESCRIPTIONS
.PP
The sections below detail options that can be placed in the
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR file, and show each option's default value.
Some options have no default value, these are listed with
``<no default>''.  Some options default to the empty string, these
are listed with ``<none>''.
*/

# OPTIONS

{ "admins", "", STRING }
/* The list of userids with administrative rights.  Separate each userid
   with a space.  Sites using Kerberos authentication may use
   separate "admin" instances.
.PP
   Note that accounts used by users should not be administrators.
   Administrative accounts should not receive mail.  That is, if user
   "jbRo" is a user reading mail, he should not also be in the admins line.
   Some problems may occur otherwise, most notably the ability of
   administrators to create top-level mailboxes visible to users,
   but not writable by users. */

{ "allowallsubscribe", 0, SWITCH }
/* Allow subscription to nonexistent mailboxes.  This option is
   typically used on backend servers in a Murder so that users can
   subscribe to mailboxes that don't reside on their "home" server.
   This option can also be used as a workaround for IMAP clients which
   don't play well with nonexistent or unselectable mailboxes (eg.
   Microsoft Outlook). */

{ "allowanonymouslogin", 0, SWITCH }
/* Permit logins by the user "anonymous" using any password.  Also
   allows use of the SASL ANONYMOUS mechanism. */

{ "allownewnews", 0, SWITCH }
/* Allow use of the NNTP NEWNEWS command.
.PP
  Note that this is a very expensive command and should only be
  enabled when absolutely necessary. */

{ "allowplaintext", 1, SWITCH }
/* Allow passwords to pass in the clear. */
   
{ "allowusermoves", 0, SWITCH }
/* Allow moving user accounts (with associated meta-data) via RENAME
   or XFER.
.PP
  Note that measures should be taken to make sure that the user being
  moved is not logged in, and can not login during the move.  Failure
  to do so may result in the user's meta-data (seen state,
  subscriptions, etc) being corrupted or out of date. */
   
{ "altnamespace", 0, SWITCH }
/* Use the alternate IMAP namespace, where personal folders reside at the
   same level in the hierarchy as INBOX.
.PP
   This option ONLY applies where interaction takes place with the
   client/user.  Currently this is limited to the IMAP protocol (imapd)
   and Sieve scripts (lmtpd).  This option does NOT apply to admin tools
   such as cyradm (admins ONLY), reconstruct, quota, etc., NOR does it
   affect LMTP delivery of messages directly to mailboxes via
   plus-addressing. */
