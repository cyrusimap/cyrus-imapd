.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pop3test
is a utility that allows you to authenticate to a POP3 server
and interactively issue commands to it. Once authenticated you may
issue any POP3 command by simply typing it in. It is capable
of multiple SASL authentication mechanisms and handles encryption
layers transparently. This utility is often used for testing the
operation of a pop3 server. Also those developing POP3 clients
find it useful.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-t " keyfile"
Enable TLS.  \fIkeyfile\fR contains the TLS public and private keys.
Specify \fB""\fR to negotiate a TLS encryption layer but not use TLS
authentication.
.TP
.BI \-p " port"
Port to connect to. If left off this defaults to \fBpop3\fR as defined in
/etc/services. 
.TP
.BI -m " mechanism"
Force pop3test to use \fImechanism\fR for authentication. If not specified
the strongest authentication mechanism supported by the server is
chosen.  Specify \fBuser\fR to use the USER/PASS commands or
\fBapop\fR to use the APOP command instead of AUTH.
.TP
.BI -u " user"
Username to use for authentication; defaults to the current user.
.TP
.BI -a " user"
Authname to use for authentication; defaults to the current user.
.TP
.BI -k " num"
Minimum protection layer required.
.TP
.BI -l " num"
Maximum protection layer to use (\fB0\fR=none; \fB1=\fRintegrity;
etc).  For example if you are using the KERBEROS_V4 authentication
mechanism specifying \fB0\fR will force pop3test to not use any layer
and specifying \fB1\fR will force it to use the integrity layer.  By
default the maximum supported protection layer will be used.
.TP
.BI -r " realm"
Specify the \fIrealm\fR to use. Certain authentication mechanisms
(e.g. DIGEST-MD5) may require one to specify the realm.
.TP
.BI -f " file"
Pipe \fIfile\fR into connection after authentication.
.TP
.BI -n " num"
Number of authentication attempts; default = 1.  The client will
attempt to do SSL/TLS session reuse and/or fast reauth
(e.g. DIGEST-MD5), if possible.
.TP
.B -s
Enable POP3 over SSL (pop3s).
.TP
.B -c
Enable challenge prompt callbacks.  This will cause the OTP mechanism
to ask for the the one-time password instead of the secret pass-phrase
(library generates the correct response).
.TP
.B -v
Verbose. Print out more information than usual.
