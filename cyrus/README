This is the Carnegie Mellon University Cyrus IMAP Server.

This distribution is what we are running on our production servers.  

The 2.2, 2.1 and 2.0 releases contains many new features over 1.6.

No further development work will progress on 1.6 so we encourage you
to work with the Cyrus 2.2 code wherever possible.  Version 1.6
has known security vulnerabilities, and is not supported.

If you continue to install this software PLEASE be sure to read the
documentation (located in the doc/ subdirectory).  Many common questions
can be answered just by carefully following the documentation.
Please also refer to http://bugzilla.andrew.cmu.edu for any outstanding bugs.

Note that CMU only provides a source distribution. If you run into
problems with any binary distribution, please contact the source of
the binary distribution.
