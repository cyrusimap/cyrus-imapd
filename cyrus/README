This is the Carnegie Mellon University Cyrus IMAP Server.

This distribution is what we are running on our production servers.  

The 2.0 release contains many new features over 1.6.

No further development work will progress on 1.6 so we encourage you
to work with the Cyrus 2.0 code wherever possible.  Support for 1.6 will
also be extremely limited.

Version 1.6 can be found at:
  ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/cyrus-imapd-1.6.24.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/BETA/cyrus-imapd-1.6.25.tar.gz

The same applies to version 1.5 of this code though you should expect absolutely
no support at all for that code base.

If you continue to install this software PLEASE be sure to read the
documentation as a number of items have changed.  Please also refer
to doc/bugs.html for any outstanding bugs with the current release. 

Note that CMU only provides a source distribution. If you run into problems 
with any binary distribution, please contact the source of the binary distribution.
