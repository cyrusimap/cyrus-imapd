This directory contains various patches to the distribution that were
either couldn't be wedged into the configure script due to system
dependancies or weren't worth getting into the configure script (laziness
plays a large part here).  They are "not supported" by us, meaning that we 
didn't try them, don't use them for whatever reasons, or were too lazy to
do a real integration at this point in time.

Bugs can still be sent to cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu. Patches are even
better.

If you wish to submit a patch, please submit either unified or context
diffs; plain diffs are hard to apply if the source has changed.
